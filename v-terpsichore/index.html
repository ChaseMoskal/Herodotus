        <h1>V TERPSICHORE</h1>

        <p id="passage-1"><a href="#passage-1" class="passage-id">1</a> The Persians left behind by King Darius in Europe, who had
Megabazus for their general, reduced, before any other Hellespontine
state, the people of Perinthus, who had no mind to become subjects
of the king. Now the Perinthians had ere this been roughly handled
by another nation, the Paeonians. For the Paeonians from about the
Strymon were once bidden by an oracle to make war upon the
Perinthians, and if these latter, when the camps faced one another,
challenged them by name to fight, then to venture on a battle, but
if otherwise, not to make the hazard. The Paeonians followed the
advice. Now the men of Perinthus drew out to meet them in the skirts
of their city; and a threefold single combat was fought on challenge
given. Man to man, and horse to horse, and dog to dog, was the
strife waged; and the Perinthians, winners of two combats out of the
three, in their joy had raised the paean; when the Paeonians struck by
the thought that this was what the oracle had meant, passed the word
one to another, saying, "Now of a surety has the oracle been fulfilled
for us; now our work begins." Then the Paeonians set upon the
Perinthians in the midst of their paean, and defeated them utterly,
leaving but few of them alive.</p>
<p id="passage-2"><a href="#passage-2" class="passage-id">2</a> Such was the affair of the Paeonians, which happened a long time
previously. At this time the Perinthians, after a brave struggle for
freedom, were overcome by numbers, and yielded to Megabazus and his
Persians. After Perinthus had been brought under, Megabazus led his
host through Thrace, subduing to the dominion of the king all the
towns and all the nations of those parts. For the king's command to
him was that he should conquer Thrace.</p>
<p id="passage-3"><a href="#passage-3" class="passage-id">3</a> The Thracians are the most powerful people in the world, except,
of course, the Indians; and if they had one head, or were agreed among
themselves, it is my belief that their match could not be found
anywhere, and that they would very far surpass all other nations.
But such union is impossible for them, and there are no means of
ever bringing it about. Herein therefore consists their weakness.
The Thracians bear many names in the different regions of their
country, but all of them have like usages in every respect,
excepting only the Getae, the Trausi, and those who dwell above the
people of Creston.</p>
<p id="passage-4"><a href="#passage-4" class="passage-id">4</a> Now the manners and customs of the Getae, who believe in their
immortality, I have already spoken of. The Trausi in all else resemble
the other Thracians, but have customs at births and deaths which I
will now describe. When a child is born all its kindred sit round
about it in a circle and weep for the woes it will have to undergo now
that it is come into the world, making mention of every ill that falls
to the lot of humankind; when, on the other hand, a man has died, they
bury him with laughter and rejoicings, and say that now he is free
from a host of sufferings, and enjoys the completest happiness.</p>
<p id="passage-5"><a href="#passage-5" class="passage-id">5</a> The Thracians who live above the Crestonaeans observe the
following customs. Each man among them has several wives; and no
sooner does a man die than a sharp contest ensues among the wives upon
the question which of them all the husband loved most tenderly; the
friends of each eagerly plead on her behalf, and she to whom the
honour is adjudged, after receiving the praises both of men and women,
is slain over the grave by the hand of her next of kin, and then
buried with her husband. The others are sorely grieved, for nothing is
considered such a disgrace.</p>
<p id="passage-6"><a href="#passage-6" class="passage-id">6</a> The Thracians who do not belong to these tribes have the customs
which follow. They sell their children to traders. On their maidens
they keep no watch, but leave them altogether free, while on the
conduct of their wives they keep a most strict watch. Brides are
purchased of their parents for large sums of money. Tattooing among
them marks noble birth, and the want of it low birth. To be idle is
accounted the most honourable thing, and to be a tiller of the
ground the most dishonourable. To live by war and plunder is of all
things the most glorious. These are the most remarkable of their
customs.</p>
<p id="passage-7"><a href="#passage-7" class="passage-id">7</a> The gods which they worship are but three, Mars, Bacchus, and
Dian. Their kings, however, unlike the rest of the citizens, worship
Mercury more than any other god, always swearing by his name, and
declaring that they are themselves sprung from him.</p>
<p id="passage-8"><a href="#passage-8" class="passage-id">8</a> Their wealthy ones are buried in the following fashion. The body
is laid out for three days; and during this time they kill victims
of all kinds, and feast upon them, after first bewailing the departed.
Then they either burn the body or else bury it in the ground.
Lastly, they raise a mound over the grave, and hold games of all
sorts, wherein the single combat is awarded the highest prize. Such is
the mode of burial among the Thracians.</p>
<p id="passage-9"><a href="#passage-9" class="passage-id">9</a> As regards the region lying north of this country no one can say
with any certainty what men inhabit it. It appears that you no
sooner cross the Ister than you enter on an interminable wilderness.
The only people of whom I can hear as dwelling beyond the Ister are
the race named Sigynnae, who wear, they say, a dress like the Medes,
and have horses which are covered entirely with a coat of shaggy hair,
five fingers in length. They are a small breed, flat-nosed, and not
strong enough to bear men on their backs; but when yoked to
chariots, they are among the swiftest known, which is the reason why
the people of that country use chariots. Their borders reach down
almost to the Eneti upon the Adriatic Sea, and they call themselves
colonists of the Medes; but how they can be colonists of the Medes I
for my part cannot imagine. Still nothing is impossible in the long
lapse of ages. Sigynnae is the name which the Ligurians who dwell
above Massilia give to traders, while among the Cyprians the word
means spears.</p>
<p id="passage-10"><a href="#passage-10" class="passage-id">10</a> According to the account which the Thracians give, the country
beyond the Ister is possessed by bees, on account of which it is
impossible to penetrate farther. But in this they seem to me to say
what has no likelihood; for it is certain that those creatures are
very impatient of cold. I rather believe that it is on account of
the cold that the regions which lie under the Bear are without
inhabitants. Such then are the accounts given of this country, the
sea-coast whereof Megabazus was now employed in subjecting to the
Persians.</p>
<p id="passage-11"><a href="#passage-11" class="passage-id">11</a> King Darius had no sooner crossed the Hellespont and reached
Sardis, than he bethought himself of the good deed of Histiaeus the
Milesian, and the good counsel of the Mytilenean Coes. He therefore
sent for both of them to Sardis, and bade them each crave a boon at
his hands. Now Histiaeus, as he was already king of Miletus, did not
make request for any government besides, but asked Darius to give
him Myrcinus of the Edonians, where he wished to build him a city.
Such was the choice that Histiaeus made. Coes, on the other hand, as
he was a mere burgher, and not a king, requested the sovereignty of
Mytilene. Both alike obtained their requests, and straight-way
betook themselves to the places which they had chosen.</p>
<p id="passage-12"><a href="#passage-12" class="passage-id">12</a> It chanced in the meantime that King Darius saw a sight which
determined him to bid Megabazus remove the Paeonians from their
seats in Europe and transport them to Asia. There were two
Paeonians, Pigres and Mantyes, whose ambition it was to obtain the
sovereignty over their countrymen. As soon therefore as ever Darius
crossed into Asia, these men came to Sardis, and brought with them
their sister, who was a tall and beautiful woman. Having so done, they
waited till a day came when the king sat in state in the suburb of the
Lydians; and then dressing their sister in the richest gear they
could, sent her to draw water for them. She bore a pitcher upon her
head, and with one arm led a horse, while all the way as she went
she span flax. Now as she passed by where the king was, Darius took
notice of her; for it was neither like the Persians nor the Lydians,
nor any of the dwellers in Asia, to do as she did. Darius
accordingly noted her, and ordered some of his guard to follow her
steps, and watch to see what she would do with the horse. So the
spearmen went; and the woman, when she came to the river, first
watered the horse, and then filling the pitcher, came back the same
way she had gone, with the pitcher of water upon her head, and the
horse dragging upon her arm, while she still kept twirling the
spindle.</p>
<p id="passage-13"><a href="#passage-13" class="passage-id">13</a> King Darius was full of wonder both at what they who had watched
the woman told him, and at what he had himself seen. So he commanded
that she should be brought before him. And the woman came; and with
her appeared her brothers, who had been watching everything a little
way off. Then Darius asked them of what nation the woman was; and
the young men replied that they were Paeonians, and she was their
sister. Darius rejoined by asking, "Who the Paeonians were, and in
what part of the world they lived? and, further, what business had
brought the young men to Sardis?" Then the brothers told him they
had come to put themselves under his power, and Paeonia was a
country upon the river Strymon, and the Strymon was at no great
distance from the Hellespont. The Paeonians, they said, were colonists
of the Teucrians from Troy. When they had thus answered his questions,
Darius asked if all the women of their country worked so hard? Then
the brothers eagerly answered, Yes; for this was the very object
with which the whole thing had been done.</p>
<p id="passage-14"><a href="#passage-14" class="passage-id">14</a> So Darius wrote letters to Megabazus, the commander whom he had
left behind in Thrace, and ordered him to remove the Paeonians from
their own land, and bring them into his presence, men, women, and
children. And straightway a horseman took the message, and rode at
speed to the Hellespont; and, crossing it, gave the paper to
Megabazus. Then Megabazus, as soon as he had read it, and procured
guides from Thrace, made war upon Paeonia.</p>
<p id="passage-15"><a href="#passage-15" class="passage-id">15</a> Now when the Paeonians heard that the Persians were marching
against them, they gathered themselves together, and marched down to
the sea-coast, since they thought the Persians would endeavour to
enter their country on that side. Here then they stood in readiness to
oppose the army of Megabazus. But the Persians, who knew that they had
collected, and were gone to keep guard at the pass near the sea, got
guides, and taking the inland route before the Paeonians were aware,
poured down upon their cities, from which the men had all marched out;
and finding them empty, easily got possession of them. Then the men,
when they heard that all their towns were taken, scattered this way
and that to their homes, and gave themselves up to the Persians. And
so these tribes of the Paeonians, to wit, the Siropaeonians, the
Paeoplians and all the others as far as Lake Prasias, were torn from
their seats and led away into Asia.</p>
<p id="passage-16"><a href="#passage-16" class="passage-id">16</a> They on the other hand who dwelt about Mount Pangaeum and in the
country of the Doberes, the Agrianians, and the Odomantians, and
they likewise who inhabited Lake Prasias, were not conquered by
Megabazus. He sought indeed to subdue the dwellers upon the lake,
but could not effect his purpose. Their manner of living is the
following. Platforms supported upon tall piles stand in the middle
of the lake, which are approached from the land by a single narrow
bridge. At the first the piles which bear up the platforms were
fixed in their places by the whole body of the citizens, but since
that time the custom which has prevailed about fixing them is this:-
they are brought from a hill called Orbelus, and every man drives in
three for each wife that he marries. Now the men have all many wives
apiece; and this is the way in which they live. Each has his own
hut, wherein he dwells, upon one of the platforms, and each has also a
trapdoor giving access to the lake beneath; and their wont is to tie
their baby children by the foot with a string, to save them from
rolling into the water. They feed their horses and their other
beasts upon fish, which abound in the lake to such a degree that a man
has only to open his trap-door and to let down a basket by a rope into
the water, and then to wait a very short time, when he draws it up
quite full of them. The fish are of two kinds, which they call the
paprax and the tilon.</p>
<p id="passage-17"><a href="#passage-17" class="passage-id">17</a> The Paeonians therefore- at least such of them as had been
conquered- were led away into Asia. As for Megabazus, he no sooner
brought the Paeonians under, than he sent into Macedonia an embassy of
Persians, choosing for the purpose the seven men of most note in all
the army after himself. These persons were to go to Amyntas, and
require him to give earth and water to King Darius. Now there is a
very short cut from the Lake Prasias across to Macedonia. Quite
close to the lake is the mine which yielded afterwards a talent of
silver a day to Alexander; and from this mine you have only to cross
the mountain called Dysorum to find yourself in the Macedonian
territory.</p>
<p id="passage-18"><a href="#passage-18" class="passage-id">18</a> So the Persians sent upon this errand, when they reached the
court, and were brought into the presence of Amyntas, required him
to give earth and water to King Darius. And Amyntas not only gave them
what they asked, but also invited them to come and feast with him;
after which he made ready the board with great magnificence, and
entertained the Persians in right friendly fashion. Now when the
meal was over, and they were all set to the drinking, the Persians
said-</p>
<p id="passage-19"><a href="#passage-19" class="passage-id">19</a> "Dear Macedonian, we Persians have a custom when we make a great
feast to bring with us to the board our wives and concubines, and make
them sit beside us. Now then, as thou hast received us so kindly,
and feasted us so handsomely, and givest moreover earth and water to
King Darius, do also after our custom in this matter."</p>
<p id="passage-20"><a href="#passage-20" class="passage-id">20</a> Then Amyntas answered- "O, Persians! we have no such custom as
this; but with us men and women are kept apart. Nevertheless, since
you, who are our lords, wish it, this also shall be granted to you."</p>
<p id="passage-21"><a href="#passage-21" class="passage-id">21</a> When Amyntas had thus spoken, he bade some go and fetch the women.
And the women came at his call and took their seats in a row over
against the Persians. Then, when the Persians saw that the women
were fair and comely, they spoke again to Amyntas and said, that "what
had been done was not wise; for it had been better for the women not
to have come at all, than to come in this way, and not sit by their
sides, but remain over against them, the torment of their eyes." So
Amyntas was forced to bid the women sit side by side with the
Persians. The women did as he ordered; and then the Persians, who
had drunk more than they ought, began to put their hands on them,
and one even tried to give the woman next him a kiss.</p>
<p id="passage-22"><a href="#passage-22" class="passage-id">22</a> King Amyntas saw, but he kept silence, although sorely grieved,
for he greatly feared the power of the Persians. Alexander, however,
Amyntas' son, who was likewise there and witnessed the whole, being
a young man and unacquainted with suffering, could not any longer
restrain himself. He therefore, full of wrath, spake thus to Amyntas:-
"Dear father, thou art old and shouldst spare thyself. Rise up from
table and go take thy rest; do not stay out the drinking. I will
remain with the guests and give them all that is fitting."</p>
<p id="passage-23"><a href="#passage-23" class="passage-id">23</a> Amyntas, who guessed that Alexander would play some wild prank,
made answer:- "Dear son, thy words sound to me as those of one who
is well nigh on fire, and I perceive thou sendest me away that thou
mayest do some wild deed. I beseech thee make no commotion about these
men, lest thou bring us all to ruin, but bear to look calmly on what
they do. For myself, I will e'en withdraw as thou biddest me."</p>
<p id="passage-24"><a href="#passage-24" class="passage-id">24</a> Amyntas, when he had thus besought his son, went out; and
Alexander said to the Persians, "Look on these ladies as your own,
dear strangers, all or any of them- only tell us your wishes. But now,
as the evening wears, and I see you have all had wine enough, let
them, if you please, retire, and when they have bathed they shall come
back again." To this the Persians agreed, and Alexander, having got
the women away, sent them off to the harem, and made ready in their
room an equal number of beardless youths, whom he dressed in the
garments of the women, and then, arming them with daggers, brought
them in to the Persians, saying as he introduced them, "Methinks, dear
Persians, that your entertainment has fallen short in nothing. We have
set before you all that we had ourselves in store, and all that we
could anywhere find to give you- and now, to crown the whole, we
make over to you our sisters and our mothers, that you may perceive
yourselves to be entirely honoured by us, even as you deserve to be-
and also that you may take back word to the king who sent you here,
that there was one man, a Greek, the satrap of Macedonia, by whom
you were both feasted and lodged handsomely." So speaking, Alexander
set by the side of each Persian one of those whom he had called
Macedonian women, but who were in truth men. And these men, when the
Persians began to be rude, despatched them with their daggers.</p>
<p id="passage-25"><a href="#passage-25" class="passage-id">25</a> So the ambassadors perished by this death, both they and also
their followers. For the Persians had brought a great train with them,
carriages, and attendants, and baggage of every kind- all of which
disappeared at the same time as the men themselves. Not very long
afterwards the Persians made strict search for their lost embassy; but
Alexander, with much wisdom, hushed up the business, bribing those
sent on the errand, partly with money, and partly with the gift of his
own sister Gygaea, whom he gave in marriage to Bubares, a Persian, the
chief leader of the expedition which came in search of the lost men.
Thus the death of these Persians was hushed up, and no more was said
of it.</p>
<p id="passage-26"><a href="#passage-26" class="passage-id">26</a> Now that the men of this family are Greeks, sprung from Perdiccas,
as they themselves affirm, is a thing which I can declare of my own
knowledge, and which I will hereafter make plainly evident. That
they are so has been already adjudged by those who manage the
Pan-Hellenic contest at Olympia. For when Alexander wished to
contend in the games, and had come to Olympia with no other view,
the Greeks who were about to run against him would have excluded him
from the contest- saying that Greeks only were allowed to contend, and
not barbarians. But Alexander proved himself to be an Argive, and
was distinctly adjudged a Greek; after which he entered the lists
for the foot-race, and was drawn to run in the first pair. Thus was
this matter settled.</p>
<p id="passage-27"><a href="#passage-27" class="passage-id">27</a> Megabazus, having reached the Hellespont with the Paeonians,
crossed it, and went up to Sardis. He had become aware while in Europe
that Histiaeus the Milesian was raising a wall at Myrcinus- the town
upon the Strymon which he had obtained from King Darius as his guerdon
for keeping the bridge. No sooner therefore did he reach Sardis with
the Paeonians than he said to Darius, "What mad thing is this that
thou hast done, sire, to let a Greek, a wise man and a shrewd, get
hold of a town in Thrace, a place too where there is abundance of
timber fit for shipbuilding, and oars in plenty, and mines of
silver, and about which are many dwellers both Greek and barbarian,
ready enough to take him for their chief, and by day and night to do
his bidding! I pray thee make this man cease his work, if thou
wouldest not be entangled in a war with thine own followers. Stop him,
but with a gentle message, only bidding him to come to thee. Then when
thou once hast him in thy power, be sure thou take good care that he
never get back to Greece again."</p>
<p id="passage-28"><a href="#passage-28" class="passage-id">28</a> With these words Megabazus easily persuaded Darius, who thought he
had shown true foresight in this matter. Darius therefore sent a
messenger to Myrcinus, who said, "These be the words of the king to
thee, O Histiaeus! I have looked to find a man well affectioned
towards me and towards my greatness; and I have found none whom I
can trust like thee. Thy deeds, and not thy words only, have proved
thy love for me. Now then, since I have a mighty enterprise in hand, I
pray thee come to me, that I may show thee what I purpose!"</p>
<p id="passage-29"><a href="#passage-29" class="passage-id">29</a> Histiaeus, when he heard this, put faith in the words of the
messenger; and, as it seemed to him a grand thing to be the king's
counsellor, he straightway went up to Sardis. Then Darius, when he was
come, said to him, "Dear Histiaeus, hear why I have sent for thee.
No sooner did I return from Scythia, and lose thee out of my sight,
than I longed, as I have never longed for aught else, to behold thee
once more, and to interchange speech with thee. Right sure I am
there is nothing in all the world so precious as a friend who is at
once wise and true: both which thou art, as I have had good proof in
what thou hast already done for me. Now then 'tis well thou art
come; for look, I have an offer to make to thee. Let go Miletus and
thy newly-founded town in Thrace, and come with me up to Susa; share
all that I have; live with me, and be my counsellor.</p>
<p id="passage-30"><a href="#passage-30" class="passage-id">30</a> When Darius had thus spoken he made Artaphernes, his brother by
the father's side, governor of Sardis, and taking Histiaeus with
him, went up to Susa. He left as general of all the troops upon the
sea-coast Otanes, son of Sisamnes, whose father King Cambyses slew and
flayed, because that he, being of the number of the royal judges,
had taken money to give an unrighteous sentence. Therefore Cambyses
slew and flayed Sisamnes, and cutting his skin into strips,
stretched them across the seat of the throne whereon he had been
wont to sit when he heard causes. Having so done Cambyses appointed
the son of Sisamnes to be judge in his father's room, and bade him
never forget in what way his seat was cushioned.</p>
<p id="passage-31"><a href="#passage-31" class="passage-id">31</a> Accordingly this Otanes, who had occupied so strange a throne,
became the successor of Megabazus in his command, and took first of
all Byzantium and Chalcidon, then Antandrus in the Troas, and next
Lamponium. This done, he borrowed ships of the Lesbians, and took
Lemnos and Imbrus, which were still inhabited by Pelasgians.</p>
<p id="passage-32"><a href="#passage-32" class="passage-id">32</a> Now the Lemnians stood on their defence, and fought gallantly; but
they were brought low in course of time. Such as outlived the struggle
were placed by the Persians under the government of Lycaretus, the
brother of that Maeandrius who was tyrant of Samos. (This Lycaretus
died afterwards in his government.) The cause which Otanes alleged for
conquering and enslaving all these nations was that some had refused
to join the king's army against Scythia, while others had molested the
host on its return. Such were the exploits which Otanes performed in
his command.</p>
<p id="passage-33"><a href="#passage-33" class="passage-id">33</a> Afterwards, but for no long time, there was a respite from
suffering. Then from Naxos and Miletus troubles gathered anew about
Ionia. Now Naxos at this time surpassed all the other islands in
prosperity, and Miletus had reached the height of her power, and was
the glory of Ionia. But previously for two generations the Milesians
had suffered grievously from civil disorders, which were composed by
the Parians, whom the Milesians chose before all the rest of the
Greeks to rearrange their government.</p>
<p id="passage-34"><a href="#passage-34" class="passage-id">34</a> Now the way in which the Parians healed their differences was
the following. A number of the chief Parians came to Miletus, and when
they saw in how ruined a condition the Milesians were, they said
that they would like first to go over their country. So they went
through all Milesia, and on their way, whenever they saw in the
waste and desolate country any land that was well farmed, they took
down the names of the owners in their tablets; and having thus gone
through the whole region, and obtained after all but few names, they
called the people together on their return to Miletus, and made
proclamation that they gave the government into the hands of those
persons whose lands they had found well farmed; for they thought it
likely (they said) that the same persons who had managed their own
affairs well would likewise conduct aright the business of the
state. The other Milesians, who in time past had been at variance,
they placed under the rule of these men. Thus was the Milesian
government set in order by the Parians.</p>
<p id="passage-35"><a href="#passage-35" class="passage-id">35</a> It was, however, from the two cities above mentioned that troubles
began now to gather again about Ionia; and this is the way in which
they arose. Certain of the rich men had been banished from Naxos by
the commonalty, and, upon their banishment, had fled to Miletus.
Aristagoras, son of Molpagoras, the nephew and likewise the son-in-law
of Histiaeus, son of Lysagoras, who was still kept by Darius at
Susa, happened to be regent of Miletus at the time of their coming.
For the kingly power belonged to Histiaeus; but he was at Susa when
the Naxians came. Now these Naxians had in times past been
bond-friends of Histiaeus; and so on their arrival at Miletus they
addressed themselves to Aristagoras and begged him to lend them such
aid as his ability allowed, in hopes thereby to recover their country.
Then Aristagoras, considering with himself that, if the Naxians should
be restored by his help, he would be lord of Naxos, put forward the
friendship with Histiaeus to cloak his views, and spoke as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-36"><a href="#passage-36" class="passage-id">36</a> "I cannot engage to furnish you with such a power as were
needful to force you, against their will, upon the Naxians who hold
the city; for I know they can bring into the field eight thousand
bucklers, and have also a vast number of ships of war. But I will do
all that lies in my power to get you some aid, and I think I can
manage it in this way. Artaphernes happens to be my friend. Now he
is a son of Hystaspes, and brother to King Darius. All the sea-coast
of Asia is under him, and he has a numerous army and numerous ships. I
think I can prevail on him to do what we require."</p>
<p id="passage-37"><a href="#passage-37" class="passage-id">37</a> When the Naxians heard this, they empowered Aristagoras to
manage the matter for them as well as he could, and told him to
promise gifts and pay for the soldiers, which (they said) they would
readily furnish, since they had great hope that the Naxians, so soon
as they saw them returned, would render them obedience, and likewise
the other islanders. For at that time not one of the Cyclades was
subject to King Darius.</p>
<p id="passage-38"><a href="#passage-38" class="passage-id">38</a> So Aristagoras went to Sardis and told Artaphernes that Naxos
was an island of no great size, but a fair land and fertile, lying
near Ionia, and containing much treasure and a vast number of
slaves. "Make war then upon this land (he said) and reinstate the
exiles; for if thou wilt do this, first of all, I have very rich gifts
in store for thee (besides the cost of the armament, which it is
fair that we who are the authors of the war should pay); and,
secondly, thou wilt bring under the power of the king not only Naxos
but the other islands which depend on it, as Paros, Andros, and all
the rest of the Cyclades. And when thou hast gained these, thou mayest
easily go on against Euboea, which is a large and wealthy island not
less in size than Cyprus, and very easy to bring under. A hundred
ships were quite enough to subdue the whole." The other answered-
"Truly thou art the author of a plan which may much advantage the
house of the king, and thy counsel is good in all points except the
number of the ships. Instead of a hundred, two hundred shall be at thy
disposal when the spring comes. But the king himself must first
approve the undertaking."</p>
<p id="passage-39"><a href="#passage-39" class="passage-id">39</a> When Aristagoras heard this he was greatly rejoiced, and went home
in good heart to Miletus. And Artaphernes, after he had sent a
messenger to Susa to lay the plans of Aristagoras before the king, and
received his approval of the undertaking, made ready a fleet of two
hundred triremes and a vast army of Persians and their confederates.
The command of these he gave to a Persian named Megabates, who
belonged to the house of the Achaemenids, being nephew both to himself
and to King Darius. It was to a daughter of this man that Pausanias
the Lacedaemonian, the son of Cleombrotus (if at least there be any
truth in the tale), was allianced many years afterwards, when he
conceived the desire of becoming tyrant of Greece. Artaphernes now,
having named Megabates to the command, sent forward the armament to
Aristagoras.</p>
<p id="passage-40"><a href="#passage-40" class="passage-id">40</a> Megabates set sail, and, touching at Miletus, took on board
Aristagoras with the Ionian troops and the Naxians; after which he
steered, as he gave out, for the Hellespont; and when he reached
Chios, he brought the fleet to anchor off Caucasa, being minded to
wait there for a north wind, and then sail straight to Naxos. The
Naxians however were not to perish at this time; and so the
following events were brought about. As Megabates went his rounds to
visit the watches on board the ships, he found a Myndian vessel upon
which there was none set. Full of anger at such carelessness, he
bade his guards to seek out the captain, one Scylax by name, and
thrusting him through one of the holes in the ship's side, to fasten
him there in such a way that his head might show outside the vessel,
while his body remained within. When Scylax was thus fastened, one
went and informed Aristagoras that Megabates had bound his Myndian
friend and was entreating him shamefully. So he came and asked
Megabates to let the man off; but the Persian refused him; whereupon
Aristagoras went himself and set Scylax free. When Megabates heard
this he was still more angry than before, and spoke hotly to
Aristagoras. Then the latter said to him-</p>
<p id="passage-41"><a href="#passage-41" class="passage-id">41</a> "What has thou to do with these matters? Wert thou not sent here
by Artaphernes to obey me, and to sail whithersoever I ordered? Why
dost meddle so?</p>
<p id="passage-42"><a href="#passage-42" class="passage-id">42</a> Thus spake Aristagoras. The other, in high dudgeon at such
language, waited till the night, and then despatched a boat to
Naxos, to warn the Naxians of the coming danger.</p>
<p id="passage-43"><a href="#passage-43" class="passage-id">43</a> Now the Naxians up to this time had not had any suspicion that the
armament was directed against them; as soon, therefore, as the message
reached them, forthwith they brought within their walls all that
they had in the open field, and made themselves ready against a
siege by provisioning their town both with food and drink. Thus was
Naxos placed in a posture of defence; and the Persians, when they
crossed the sea from Chios, found the Naxians fully prepared for them.
However they sat down before the place, and besieged it for four whole
months. When at length all the stores which they had brought with them
were exhausted, and Aristagoras had likewise spent upon the siege no
small sum from his private means, and more was still needed to
insure success, the Persians gave up the attempt, and first building
certain forts, wherein they left the banished Naxians, withdrew to the
mainland, having utterly failed in their undertaking.</p>
<p id="passage-44"><a href="#passage-44" class="passage-id">44</a> And now Aristagoras found himself quite unable to make good his
promises to Artaphernes; nay, he was even hard pressed to meet the
claims whereto he was liable for the pay of the troops; and at the
same time his fear was great, lest, owing to the failure of the
expedition and his own quarrel with Megabates, he should be ousted
from the government of Miletus. These manifold alarms had already
caused him to contemplate raising a rebellion, when the man with the
marked head came from Susa, bringing him instructions on the part of
Histiaeus to revolt from the king. For Histiaeus, when he was
anxious to give Aristagoras orders to revolt, could find but one
safe way, as the roads were guarded, of making his wishes known; which
was by taking the trustiest of his slaves, shaving all the hair from
off his head, and then pricking letters upon the skin, and waiting
till the hair grew again. Thus accordingly he did; and as soon as ever
the hair was grown, he despatched the man to Miletus, giving him no
other message than this- "When thou art come to Miletus, bid
Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon." Now the marks on the
head, as I have already mentioned, were a command to revolt. All
this Histiaeus did because it irked him greatly to be kept at Susa,
and because he had strong hopes that, if troubles broke out, he
would be sent down to the coast to quell them, whereas, if Miletus
made no movement, he did not see a chance of his ever again
returning thither.</p>
<p id="passage-45"><a href="#passage-45" class="passage-id">45</a> Such, then, were the views which led Histiaeus to despatch his
messenger; and it so chanced that all these several motives to
revolt were brought to bear upon Aristagoras at one and the same time.</p>
<p id="passage-46"><a href="#passage-46" class="passage-id">46</a> Accordingly, at this conjuncture Aristagoras held a council of his
trusty friends, and laid the business before them, telling them both
what he had himself purposed, and what message had been sent him by
Histiaeus. At this council all his friends were of the same way of
thinking, and recommended revolt, except only Hecataeus the historian.
He, first of all, advised them by all means to avoid engaging in war
with the king of the Persians, whose might he set forth, and whose
subject nations he enumerated. As however he could not induce them
to listen to this counsel, he next advised that they should do all
that lay in their power to make themselves masters of the sea.
"There was one only way," he said, "so far as he could see, of their
succeeding in this. Miletus was, he knew, a weak state- but if the
treasures in the temple at Branchidae, which Croesus the Lydian gave
to it, were seized, he had strong hopes that the mastery of the sea
might be thereby gained; at least it would give them money to begin
the war, and would save the treasures from falling into the hands of
the enemy." Now these treasures were of very great value, as I
showed in the first part of my History. The assembly, however,
rejected the counsel of Hecataeus, while, nevertheless, they
resolved upon a revolt. One of their number, it was agreed, should
sail to Myus, where the fleet had been lying since its return from
Naxos, and endeavour to seize the captains who had gone there with the
vessels.</p>
<p id="passage-47"><a href="#passage-47" class="passage-id">47</a> Iatragoras accordingly was despatched on this errand, and he
took with guile Oliatus the son of Ibanolis the Mylassian, and
Histiaeus the son of Tymnes the Termerean-Coes likewise, the son of
Erxander, to whom Darius gave Mytilene, and Aristagoras the son of
Heraclides the Cymaean, and also many others. Thus Aristagoras
revolted openly from Darius; and now he set to work to scheme
against him in every possible way. First of all, in order to induce
the Milesians to join heartily in the revolt, he gave out that he laid
down his own lordship over Miletus, and in lieu thereof established
a commonwealth: after which, throughout all Ionia he did the like; for
from some of the cities he drove out their tyrants, and to others,
whose goodwill he hoped thereby to gain, he handed theirs over, thus
giving up all the men whom he had seized at the Naxian fleet, each
to the city whereto he belonged.</p>
<p id="passage-48"><a href="#passage-48" class="passage-id">48</a> Now the Mytileneans had no sooner got Coes into their power,
than they led him forth from the city and stoned him; the Cymaeans, on
the other hand, allowed their tyrant to go free; as likewise did
most of the others. And so this form of government ceased throughout
all the cities. Aristagoras the Milesian, after he had in this way put
down the tyrants, and bidden the cities choose themselves captains
in their room, sailed away himself on board a trireme to Lacedaemon;
for he had great need of obtaining the aid of some powerful ally.</p>
<p id="passage-49"><a href="#passage-49" class="passage-id">49</a> At Sparta, Anaxandridas the son of Leo was no longer king: he
had died, and his son Cleomenes had mounted the throne, not however by
right of merit, but of birth. Anaxandridas took to wife his own
sister's daughter, and was tenderly attached to her; but no children
came from the marriage. Hereupon the Ephors called him before them,
and said- "If thou hast no care for thine own self, nevertheless we
cannot allow this, nor suffer the race of Eurysthenes to die out
from among us. Come then, as thy present wife bears thee no
children, put her away, and wed another. So wilt thou do what is
well-pleasing to the Spartans." Anaxandridas however refused to do
as they required, and said it was no good advice the Ephors gave, to
bid him put away his wife when she had done no wrong, and take to
himself another. He therefore declined to obey them.</p>
<p id="passage-50"><a href="#passage-50" class="passage-id">50</a> Then the Ephors and Elders took counsel together, and laid this
proposal before the king:- "Since thou art so fond, as we see thee
to be, of thy present wife, do what we now advise, and gainsay us not,
lest the Spartans make some unwonted decree concerning thee. We ask
thee not now to put away thy wife to whom thou art married- give her
still the same love and honour as ever- but take thee another wife
beside, who may bear thee children."</p>
<p id="passage-51"><a href="#passage-51" class="passage-id">51</a> When he heard this offer, Anaxandridas gave way- and henceforth he
lived with two wives in two separate houses, quite against all Spartan
custom.</p>
<p id="passage-52"><a href="#passage-52" class="passage-id">52</a> In a short time, the wife whom he had last married bore him a son,
who received the name of Cleomenes; and so the heir to the throne
was brought into the world by her. After this, the first wife also,
who in time past had been barren, by some strange chance conceived,
and came to be with child. Then the friends of the second wife, when
they heard a rumour of the truth, made a great stir, and said it was a
false boast, and she meant, they were sure, to bring forward as her
own a supposititious child. So they raised an outcry against her;
and therefore, when her full time was come, the Ephors, who were
themselves incredulous, sat round her bed, and kept a strict watch
on the labour. At this time then she bore Dorieus, and after him,
quickly, Leonidas, and after him, again quickly, Cleombrotus. Some
even say that Leonidas and Cleombrotus were twins. On the other
hand, the second wife, the mother of Cleomenes (who was a daughter
of Prinetadas, the son of Demarmenus), never gave birth to a second
child.</p>
<p id="passage-53"><a href="#passage-53" class="passage-id">53</a> Now Cleomenes, it is said, was not right in his mind; indeed he
verged upon madness; while Dorieus surpassed all his co-mates, and
looked confidently to receiving the kingdom on the score of merit.
When, therefore, after the death of Anaxandridas, the Spartans kept to
the law, and made Cleomenes, his eldest son, king in his room,
Dorieus, who had imagined that he should be chosen, and who could
not bear the thought of having such a man as Cleomenes to rule over
him, asked the Spartans to give him a body of men, and left Sparta
with them in order to found a colony. However, he neither took counsel
of the oracle at Delphi as to the place whereto he should go, nor
observed any of the customary usages; but left Sparta in dudgeon,
and sailed away to Libya, under the guidance of certain men who were
Theraeans. These men brought him to Cinyps, where he colonised a spot,
which has not its equal in all Libya, on the banks of a river: but
from this place he was driven in the third year by the Macians, the
Libyans, and the Carthaginians.</p>
<p id="passage-54"><a href="#passage-54" class="passage-id">54</a> Dorieus returned to the Peloponnese; whereupon Antichares the
Eleonian gave him a counsel (which he got from the oracle of Laius),
to "found the city of Heraclea in Sicily; the whole country of Eryx
belonged," he said, "to the Heracleids, since Hercules himself
conquered it." On receiving this advice, Dorieus went to Delphi to
inquire of the oracle whether he would take the place to which he
was about to go. The Pythoness prophesied that he would; whereupon
Dorieus went back to Libya, took up the men who had sailed with him at
the first, and proceeded upon his way along the shores of Italy.</p>
<p id="passage-55"><a href="#passage-55" class="passage-id">55</a> Just at this time, the Sybarites say, they and their king Telys
were about to make war upon Crotona, and the Crotoniats, greatly
alarmed, besought Dorieus to lend them aid. Dorieus was prevailed
upon, bore part in the war against Sybaris, and had a share in
taking the town. Such is the account which the Sybarites give of
what was done by Dorieus and his companions. The Crotoniats, on the
other hand, maintain that no foreigner lent them aid in their war
against the Sybarites, save and except Callias the Elean, a soothsayer
of the race of the Iamidae; and he only forsook Telys the Sybaritic
king, and deserted to their side, when he found on sacrificing that
the victims were not favourable to an attack on Crotona. Such is the
account which each party gives of these matters.</p>
<p id="passage-56"><a href="#passage-56" class="passage-id">56</a> Both parties likewise adduce testimonies to the truth of what they
say. The Sybarites show a temple and sacred precinct near the dry
stream of the Crastis, which they declare that Dorieus, after taking
their city, dedicated to Minerva Crastias. And further, they bring
forward the death of Dorieus as the surest proof; since he fell,
they say, because he disobeyed the oracle. For had he in nothing
varied from the directions given him, but confined himself to the
business on which he was sent, he would assuredly have conquered the
Erycian territory, and kept possession of it, instead of perishing
with all his followers. The Crotoniats, on the other hand, point to
the numerous allotments within their borders which were assigned to
Callias the Elean by their countrymen, and which to my day remained in
the possession of his family; while Dorieus and his descendants
(they remark) possess nothing. Yet if Dorieus had really helped them
in the Sybaritic war, he would have received very much more than
Callias. Such are the testimonies which are adduced on either side; it
is open to every man to adopt whichever view he deems the best.</p>
<p id="passage-57"><a href="#passage-57" class="passage-id">57</a> Certain Spartans accompanied Dorieus on his voyage as co-founders,
to wit, Thessalus, Paraebates, Celeas, and Euryleon. These men and all
the troops under their command reached Sicily; but there they fell
in a battle wherein they were defeated by the Egestaeans and
Phoenicians, only one, Euryleon, surviving the disaster. He then,
collecting the remnants of the beaten army, made himself master of
Minoa, the Selinusian colony, and helped the Selinusians to throw
off the yoke of their tyrant Peithagoras. Having upset Peithagoras, he
sought to become tyrant in his room, and he even reigned at Selinus
for a brief space- but after a while the Selinusians rose up in revolt
against him, and though he fled to the altar of Jupiter Agoraeus, they
notwithstanding put him to death.</p>
<p id="passage-58"><a href="#passage-58" class="passage-id">58</a> Another man who accompanied Dorieus, and died with him, was Philip
the son of Butacidas, a man of Crotona; who, after he had been
betrothed to a daughter of Telys the Sybarite, was banished from
Crotona, whereupon his marriage came to nought; and he in his
disappointment took ship and sailed to Cyrene. From thence he became a
follower of Dorieus, furnishing to the fleet a trireme of his own, the
crew of which he supported at his own charge. This Philip was an
Olympian victor, and the handsomest Greek of his day. His beauty
gained him honours at the hands of the Egestaeans which they never
accorded to any one else; for they raised a hero-temple over his
grave, and they still worship him with sacrifices.</p>
<p id="passage-59"><a href="#passage-59" class="passage-id">59</a> Such then was the end of Dorieus, who if he had brooked the rule
of Cleomenes, and remained in Sparta, would have been king of
Lacedaemon; since Cleomenes, after reigning no great length of time,
died without male offspring, leaving behind him an only daughter, by
name Gorgo.</p>
<p id="passage-60"><a href="#passage-60" class="passage-id">60</a> Cleomenes, however, was still king when Aristagoras, tyrant of
Miletus, reached Sparta. At their interview, Aristagoras, according to
the report of the Lacedaemonians, produced a bronze tablet,
whereupon the whole circuit of the earth was engraved, with all its
seas and rivers. Discourse began between the two; and Aristagoras
addressed the Spartan king in these words following:- "Think it not
strange, O King Cleomenes, that I have been at the pains to sail
hither; for the posture of affairs, which I will now recount unto
thee, made it fitting. Shame and grief is it indeed to none so much as
to us, that the sons of the Ionians should have lost their freedom,
and come to be the slaves of others; but yet it touches you
likewise, O Spartans, beyond the rest of the Greeks, inasmuch as the
pre-eminence over all Greece appertains to you. We beseech you,
therefore, by the common gods of the Grecians, deliver the Ionians,
who are your own kinsmen, from slavery. Truly the task is not
difficult; for the barbarians are an unwarlike people; and you are the
best and bravest warriors in the whole world. Their mode of fighting
is the following:- they use bows and arrows and a short spear; they
wear trousers in the field, and cover their heads with turbans. So
easy are they to vanquish! Know too that the dwellers in these parts
have more good things than all the rest of the world put together-
gold, and silver, and brass, and embroidered garments, beasts of
burthen, and bond-servants- all which, if you only wish it, you may
soon have for your own. The nations border on one another, in the
order which I will now explain. Next to these Ionians" (here he
pointed with his finger to the map of the world which was engraved
upon the tablet that he had brought with him) "these Lydians dwell;
their soil is fertile, and few people are so rich in silver. Next to
them," he continued, "come these Phrygians, who have more flocks and
herds than any race that I know, and more plentiful harvests. On
them border the Cappadocians, whom we Greeks know by the name of
Syrians: they are neighbours to the Cilicians, who extend all the
way to this sea, where Cyprus (the island which you see here) lies.
The Cilicians pay the king a yearly tribute of five hundred talents.
Next to them come the Armenians, who live here- they too have numerous
flocks and herds. After them come the Matieni, inhabiting this
country; then Cissia, this province, where you see the river
Choaspes marked, and likewise the town Susa upon its banks, where
the Great King holds his court, and where the treasuries are in
which his wealth is stored. Once masters of this city, you may be bold
to vie with Jove himself for riches. In the wars which ye wage with
your rivals of Messenia, with them of Argos likewise and of Arcadia,
about paltry boundaries and strips of land not so remarkably good,
ye contend with those who have no gold, nor silver even, which often
give men heart to fight and die. Must ye wage such wars, and when ye
might so easily be lords of Asia, will ye decide otherwise?" Thus
spoke Aristagoras; and Cleomenes replied to him,- "Milesian
stranger, three days hence I will give thee an answer."</p>
<p id="passage-61"><a href="#passage-61" class="passage-id">61</a> So they proceeded no further at that time. When, however, the
day appointed for the answer came, and the two once more met,
Cleomenes asked Aristagoras, "how many days' journey it was from the
sea of the Ionians to the king's residence?" Hereupon Aristagoras, who
had managed the rest so cleverly, and succeeded in deceiving the king,
tripped in his speech and blundered; for instead of concealing the
truth, as he ought to have done if he wanted to induce the Spartans to
cross into Asia, he said plainly that it was a journey of three
months. Cleomenes caught at the words, and, preventing Aristagoras
from finishing what he had begun to say concerning the road, addressed
him thus:- "Milesian stranger, quit Sparta before sunset. This is no
good proposal that thou makest to the Lacedaemonians, to conduct
them a distance of three months' journey from the sea." When he had
thus spoken, Cleomenes went to his home.</p>
<p id="passage-62"><a href="#passage-62" class="passage-id">62</a> But Aristagoras took an olive-bough in his hand, and hastened to
the king's house, where he was admitted by reason of his suppliant's
pliant's guise. Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes, and his only
child, a girl of about eight or nine years of age, happened to be
there, standing by her father's side. Aristagoras, seeing her,
requested Cleomenes to send her out of the room before he began to
speak with him; but Cleomenes told him to say on, and not mind the
child. So Aristagoras began with a promise of ten talents if the
king would grant him his request, and when Cleomenes shook his head,
continued to raise his offer till it reached fifty talents;
whereupon the child spoke:- "Father," she said, "get up and go, or the
stranger will certainly corrupt thee." Then Cleomenes, pleased at
the warning of his child, withdrew and went into another room.
Aristagoras quitted Sparta for good, not being able to discourse any
more concerning the road which led up to the king.</p>
<p id="passage-63"><a href="#passage-63" class="passage-id">63</a> Now the true account of the road in question is the following:-
Royal stations exist along its whole length, and excellent
caravanserais; and throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is
free from danger. In Lydia and Phrygia there are twenty stations
within a distance Of 94 1/2 parasangs. On leaving Phrygia the Halys
has to be crossed; and here are gates through which you must needs
pass ere you can traverse the stream. A strong force guards this post.
When you have made the passage, and are come into Cappadocia, 28
stations and 104 parasangs bring you to the borders of Cilicia,
where the road passes through two sets of gates, at each of which
there is a guard posted. Leaving these behind, you go on through
Cilicia, where you find three stations in a distance of 15 1/2
parasangs. The boundary between Cilicia and Armenia is the river
Euphrates, which it is necessary to cross in boats. In Armenia the
resting-places are 15 in number, and the distance is 56 1/2 parasangs.
There is one place where a guard is posted. Four large streams
intersect this district, all of which have to be crossed by means of
boats. The first of these is the Tigris; the second and the third have
both of them the same name, though they are not only different rivers,
but do not even run from the same place. For the one which I have
called the first of the two has its source in Armenia, while the other
flows afterwards out of the country of the Matienians. The fourth of
the streams is called the Gyndes, and this is the river which Cyrus
dispersed by digging for it three hundred and sixty channels.
Leaving Armenia and entering the Matienian country, you have four
stations; these passed you find yourself in Cissia, where eleven
stations and 42 1/2 parasangs bring you to another navigable stream,
the Choaspes, on the banks of which the city of Susa is built. Thus
the entire number of the stations is raised to one hundred and eleven;
and so many are in fact the resting-places that one finds between
Sardis and Susa.</p>
<p id="passage-64"><a href="#passage-64" class="passage-id">64</a> If then the royal road be measured aright, and the parasang
equals, as it does, thirty furlongs, the whole distance from Sardis to
the palace of Memnon (as it is called), amounting thus to 450
parasangs, would be 13,500 furlongs. Travelling then at the rate of
150 furlongs a day, one will take exactly ninety days to perform the
journey.</p>
<p id="passage-65"><a href="#passage-65" class="passage-id">65</a> Thus when Aristagoras the Milesian told Cleomenes the
Lacedaemonian that it was a three months' journey from the sea up to
the king, he said no more than the truth. The exact distance (if any
one desires still greater accuracy) is somewhat more; for the
journey from Ephesus to Sardis must be added to the foregoing account;
and this will make the whole distance between the Greek Sea and Susa
(or the city of Memnon, as it is called) 14,040 furlongs; since
Ephesus is distant from Sardis 540 furlongs. This would add three days
to the three months' journey.</p>
<p id="passage-66"><a href="#passage-66" class="passage-id">66</a> When Aristagoras left Sparta he hastened to Athens, which had
got quit of its tyrants in the way that I will now describe. After the
death of Hipparchus (the son of Pisistratus, and brother of the tyrant
Hippias), who, in spite of the clear warning he had received
concerning his fate in a dream, was slain by Harmodius and
Aristogeiton (men both of the race of the Gephyraeans), the oppression
of the Athenians continued by the space of four years; and they gained
nothing, but were worse used than before.</p>
<p id="passage-67"><a href="#passage-67" class="passage-id">67</a> Now the dream of Hipparchus was the following:- The night before
the Panathenaic festival, he thought he saw in his sleep a tall and
beautiful man, who stood over him, and read him the following riddle:-</p>
<p id="passage-68"><a href="#passage-68" class="passage-id">68</a> > Bear thou unbearable woes with the all-bearing heart of a lion;</p>
<p id="passage-69"><a href="#passage-69" class="passage-id">69</a> > Never, be sure, shall wrong-doer escape the reward of
>   wrong-doing.</p>
<p id="passage-70"><a href="#passage-70" class="passage-id">70</a> As soon as day dawned he sent and submitted his dream to the
interpreters, after which he offered the averting sacrifices, and then
went and led the procession in which he perished.</p>
<p id="passage-71"><a href="#passage-71" class="passage-id">71</a> The family of the Gephyraeans, to which the murderers of
Hipparchus belonged, according to their own account, came originally
from Eretria. My inquiries, however, have made it clear to me that
they are in reality Phoenicians, descendants of those who came with
Cadmus into the country now called Boeotia. Here they received for
their portion the district of Tanagra, in which they afterwards dwelt.
On their expulsion from this country by the Boeotians (which
happened some time after that of the Cadmeians from the same parts
by the Argives) they took refuge at Athens. The Athenians received
them among their citizens upon set terms, whereby they were excluded
from a number of privileges which are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p id="passage-72"><a href="#passage-72" class="passage-id">72</a> Now the Phoenicians who came with Cadmus, and to whom the
Gephyraei belonged, introduced into Greece upon their arrival a
great variety of arts, among the rest that of writing, whereof the
Greeks till then had, as I think, been ignorant. And originally they
shaped their letters exactly like all the other Phoenicians, but
afterwards, in course of time, they changed by degrees their language,
and together with it the form likewise of their characters. Now the
Greeks who dwelt about those parts at that time were chiefly the
Ionians. The Phoenician letters were accordingly adopted by them,
but with some variation in the shape of a few, and so they arrived
at the present use, still calling the letters Phoenician, as justice
required, after the name of those who were the first to introduce them
into Greece. Paper rolls also were called from of old "parchments"
by the Ionians, because formerly when paper was scarce they used,
instead, the skins of sheep and goats- on which material many of the
barbarians are even now wont to write.</p>
<p id="passage-73"><a href="#passage-73" class="passage-id">73</a> I myself saw Cadmeian characters engraved upon some tripods in the
temple of Apollo Ismenias in Boeotian Thebes, most of them shaped like
the Ionian. One of the tripods has the inscription following:-</p>
<p id="passage-74"><a href="#passage-74" class="passage-id">74</a> > Me did Amphitryon place, from the far Teleboans coming.</p>
<p id="passage-75"><a href="#passage-75" class="passage-id">75</a> This would be about the age of Laius, the son of Labdacus, the son
of Polydorus, the son of Cadmus.</p>
<p id="passage-76"><a href="#passage-76" class="passage-id">76</a> Another of the tripods has this legend in the hexameter measure:-</p>
<p id="passage-77"><a href="#passage-77" class="passage-id">77</a> > I to far-shooting Phoebus was offered by Scaeus the boxer,
> When he had won at the games- a wondrous beautiful offering.</p>
<p id="passage-78"><a href="#passage-78" class="passage-id">78</a> This might be Scaeus, the son of Hippocoon; and the tripod, if
dedicated by him, and not by another of the same name, would belong to
the time of Oedipus, the son of Laius.</p>
<p id="passage-79"><a href="#passage-79" class="passage-id">79</a> The third tripod has also an inscription in hexameters, which runs
thus:-</p>
<p id="passage-80"><a href="#passage-80" class="passage-id">80</a> > King Laodamas gave this tripod to far-seeing Phoebus,
> When he was set on the throne- a wondrous beautiful offering.</p>
<p id="passage-81"><a href="#passage-81" class="passage-id">81</a> It was in the reign of this Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, that the
Cadmeians were driven by the Argives out of their country, and found a
shelter with the Encheleans. The Gephyraeans at that time remained
in the country, but afterwards they retired before the Boeotians,
and took refuge at Athens, where they have a number of temples for
their separate use, which the other Athenians are not allowed to
enter- among the rest, one of Achaean Ceres, in whose honour they
likewise celebrate special orgies.</p>
<p id="passage-82"><a href="#passage-82" class="passage-id">82</a> Having thus related the dream which Hipparchus saw, and traced the
descent of the Gephyraeans, the family whereto his murderers belonged,
I must proceed with the matter whereof I was intending before to
speak; to wit, the way in which the Athenians got quit of their
tyrants. Upon the death of Hipparchus, Hippias, who was king, grew
harsh towards the Athenians; and the Alcaeonidae, an Athenian family
which had been banished by the Pisistratidae, joined the other exiles,
and endeavoured to procure their own return, and to free Athens, by
force. They seized and fortified Leipsydrium above Paeonia, and
tried to gain their object by arms; but great disasters befell them,
and their purpose remained unaccomplished. They therefore resolved
to shrink from no contrivance that might bring them success; and
accordingly they contracted with the Amphictyons to build the temple
which now stands at Delphi, but which in those days did not exist.
Having done this, they proceeded, being men of great wealth and
members of an ancient and distinguished family, to build the temple
much more magnificently than the plan obliged them. Besides other
improvements, instead of the coarse stone whereof by the contract
the temple was to have been constructed, they made the facings of
Parian marble.</p>
<p id="passage-83"><a href="#passage-83" class="passage-id">83</a> These same men, if we may believe the Athenians, during their stay
at Delphi persuaded the Pythoness by a bribe to tell the Spartans,
whenever any of them came to consult the oracle, either on their own
private affairs or on the business of the state, that they must free
Athens. So the Lacedaemonians, when they found no answer ever returned
to them but this, sent at last Anchimolius, the son of Aster- a man of
note among their citizens- at the head of an army against Athens, with
orders to drive out the Pisistratidae, albeit they were bound to
them by the closest ties of friendship. For they esteemed the things
of heaven more highly than the things of men. The troops went by sea
and were conveyed in transports. Anchimolius brought them to an
anchorage at Phalerum; and there the men disembarked. But the
Pisistratidae, who had previous knowledge of their intentions, had
sent to Thessaly, between which country and Athens there was an
alliance, with a request for aid. The Thessalians, in reply to their
entreaties, sent them by a public vote 1000 horsemen, under the
command of their king, Cineas, who was a Coniaean. When this help
came, the Pisistratidae laid their plan accordingly: they cleared
the whole plain about Phalerum so as to make it fit for the
movements of cavalry, and then charged the enemy's camp with their
horse, which fell with such fury upon the Lacedaemonians as to kill
numbers, among the rest Anchimolius, the general, and to drive the
remainder to their ships. Such was the fate of the first army sent
from Lacedaemon, and the tomb of Anchimolius may be seen to this day
in Attica; it is at Alopecae (Foxtown), near the temple of Hercules in
Cynosargos.</p>
<p id="passage-84"><a href="#passage-84" class="passage-id">84</a> Afterwards, the Lacedaemonians despatched a larger force against
Athens, which they put under the command of Cleomenes, son of
Anaxandridas, one of their kings. These troops were not sent by sea,
but marched by the mainland. When they were come into Attica, their
first encounter was with the Thessalian horse, which they shortly
put to flight, killing above forty men; the remainder made good
their escape, and fled straight to Thessaly. Cleomenes proceeded to
the city, and, with the aid of such of the Athenians as wished for
freedom, besieged the tyrants, who had shut themselves up in the
Pelasgic fortress.</p>
<p id="passage-85"><a href="#passage-85" class="passage-id">85</a> And now there had been small chance of the Pisistratidae falling
into the hands of the Spartans, who did not even design to sit down
before the place, which had moreover been well provisioned
beforehand with stores both of meat and drink,- nay, it is likely that
after a few days' blockade the Lacedaemonians would have quitted
Attica altogether, and gone back to Sparta- had not an event
occurred most unlucky for the besieged, and most advantageous for
the besiegers. The children of the Pisistratidae were made
prisoners, as they were being removed out of the country. By this
calamity all their plans were deranged, and-as the ransom of their
children- they consented to the demands of the Athenians, and agreed
within five days' time to quit Attica. Accordingly they soon
afterwards left the country, and withdrew to Sigeum on the
Scamander, after reigning thirty-six years over the Athenians. By
descent they were Pylians, of the family of the Neleids, to which
Codrus and Melanthus likewise belonged, men who in former times from
foreign settlers became kings of Athens. And hence it was that
Hippocrates came to think of calling his son Pisistratus: he named him
after the Pisistratus who was a son of Nestor. Such then was the
mode in which the Athenians got quit of their tyrants. What they did
and suffered worthy of note from the time when they gained their
freedom until the revolt of Ionia from King Darius, and the coming
of Aristagoras to Athens with a request that the Athenians would
lend the Ionians aid, I shall now proceed to relate.</p>
<p id="passage-86"><a href="#passage-86" class="passage-id">86</a> The power of Athens had been great before; but, now that the
tyrants were gone, it became greater than ever. The chief authority
was lodged with two persons, Clisthenes, of the family of the
Alcmaeonids, who is said to have been the persuader of the
Pythoness, and Isagoras, the son of Tisander, who belonged to a
noble house, but whose pedigree I am not able to trace further.
Howbeit his kinsmen offer sacrifice to the Carian Jupiter. These two
men strove together for the mastery; and Clisthenes, finding himself
the weaker, called to his aid the common people. Hereupon, instead
of the four tribes among which the Athenians had been divided
hitherto, Clisthenes made ten tribes, and parcelled out the
Athenians among them. He likewise changed the names of the tribes; for
whereas they had till now been called after Geleon, Aegicores,
Argades, and Hoples, the four sons of Ion, Clisthenes set these
names aside, and called his tribes after certain other heroes, all
of whom were native, except Ajax. Ajax was associated because,
although a foreigner, he was a neighbour and an ally of Athens.</p>
<p id="passage-87"><a href="#passage-87" class="passage-id">87</a> My belief is that in acting thus he did but imitate his maternal
grandfather, Clisthenes, king of Sicyon. This king, when he was at war
with Argos, put an end to the contests of the rhapsodists at Sicyon,
because in the Homeric poems Argos and the Argives were so
constantly the theme of song. He likewise conceived the wish to
drive Adrastus, the son of Talaus, out of his country, seeing that
he was an Argive hero. For Adrastus had a shrine at Sicyon, which
yet stands in the market-place of the town. Clisthenes therefore
went to Delphi, and asked the oracle if he might expel Adrastus. To
this the Pythoness is reported to have answered- "Adrastus is the
Sicyonians' king, but thou art only a robber." So when the god would
not grant his request, he went home and began to think how he might
contrive to make Adrastus withdraw of his own accord. After a while he
hit upon a plan which he thought would succeed. He sent envoys to
Thebes in Boeotia, and informed the Thebans that he wished to bring
Melanippus, the son of Astacus, to Sicyon. The Thebans consenting,
Clisthenes carried Melanippus back with him, assigned him a precinct
within the government-house, and built him a shrine there in the
safest and strongest part. The reason for his so doing (which I must
not forbear to mention) was because Melanippus was Adrastus' great
enemy, having slain both his brother Mecistes and his son-in-law
Tydeus. Clisthenes, after assigning the precinct to Melanippus, took
away from Adrastus the sacrifices and festivals wherewith he had
till then been honoured, and transferred them to his adversary.
Hitherto the Sicyonians had paid extraordinary honours to Adrastus,
because the country had belonged to Polybus, and Adrastus was Polybus'
daughter's son; whence it came to pass that Polybus, dying
childless, left Adrastus his kingdom. Besides other ceremonies, it had
been their wont to honour Adrastus with tragic choruses, which they
assigned to him rather than Bacchus, on account of his calamities.
Clisthenes now gave the choruses to Bacchus, transferring to
Melanippus the rest of the sacred rites.</p>
<p id="passage-88"><a href="#passage-88" class="passage-id">88</a> Such were his doings in the matter of Adrastus. With respect to
the Dorian tribes, not choosing the Sicyonians to have the same tribes
as the Argives, he changed all the old names for new ones; and here he
took special occasion to mock the Sicyonians, for he drew his new
names from the words "pig," and "ass," adding thereto the usual
tribe-endings; only in the case of his own tribe he did nothing of the
sort, but gave them a name drawn from his own kingly office. For he
called his own tribe the Archelai, or Rulers, while the others he
named Hyatae, or Pig-folk, Oneatae, or Assfolk, and Choereatae, or
Swine-folk. The Sicyonians kept these names, not only during the reign
of Clisthenes, but even after his death, by the space of sixty
years: then, however, they took counsel together, and changed to the
well-known names of Hyllaeans, Pamphylians, and Dymanatae, taking at
the same time, as a fourth name, the title of Aegialeans, from
Aegialeus the son of Adrastus.</p>
<p id="passage-89"><a href="#passage-89" class="passage-id">89</a> Thus had Clisthenes the Sicyonian done. The Athenian Clisthenes,
who was grandson by the mother's side of the other, and had been named
after him, resolved, from contempt (as I believe) of the Ionians, that
his tribes should not be the same as theirs; and so followed the
pattern set him by his namesake of Sicyon. Having brought entirely
over to his own side the common people of Athens, whom he had before
disdained, he gave all the tribes new names, and made the number
greater than formerly; instead of the four phylarchs he established
ten; he likewise placed ten demes in each of the tribes; and he was,
now that the common people took his part, very much more powerful than
his adversaries.</p>
<p id="passage-90"><a href="#passage-90" class="passage-id">90</a> Isagoras in his turn lost ground; and therefore, to counter-plot
his enemy, he called in Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian, who had
already, at the time when he was besieging the Pisistratidae, made a
contract of friendship with him. A charge is even brought against
Cleomenes that he was on terms of too great familiarity with
Isagoras's wife. At this time the first thing that he did was to
send a herald and require that Clisthenes, and a large number of
Athenians besides, whom he called "The Accursed," should leave Athens.
This message he sent at the suggestion of Isagoras: for in the
affair referred to, the blood-guiltiness lay on the Alcmaeonidae and
their partisans, while he and his friends were quite clear of it.</p>
<p id="passage-91"><a href="#passage-91" class="passage-id">91</a> The way in which "The Accursed" at Athens got their name, was
the following. There was a certain Athenian called Cylon, a victor
at the Olympic Games, who aspired to the sovereignty, and aided by a
number of his companions, who were of the same age with himself,
made an attempt to seize the citadel. But the attack failed; and Cylon
became a suppliant at the image. Hereupon the Heads of the Naucraries,
who at that time bore rule in Athens, induced the fugitives to
remove by a promise to spare their lives. Nevertheless they were all
slain; and the blame was laid on the Alcmaeonidae. All this happened
before the time of Pisistratus.</p>
<p id="passage-92"><a href="#passage-92" class="passage-id">92</a> When the message of Cleomenes arrived, requiring Clisthenes and
"The Accursed" to quit the city, Clisthenes departed of his own
accord. Cleomenes, however, notwithstanding his departure, came to
Athens, with a small band of followers; and on his arrival sent into
banishment seven hundred Athenian families, which were pointed out
to him by Isagoras. Succeeding here, he next endeavoured to dissolve
the council, and to put the government into the hands of three hundred
of the partisans of that leader. But the council resisted, and refused
to obey his orders; whereupon Cleomenes, Isagoras, and their followers
took possession of the citadel. Here they were attacked by the rest of
the Athenians, who took the side of the council, and were besieged for
the space of two days: on the third day they accepted terms, being
allowed- at least such of them as were Lacedaemonians- to quit the
country. And so the word which came to Cleomenes received its
fulfilment. For when he first went up into the citadel, meaning to
seize it, just as he was entering the sanctuary of the goddess, in
order to question her, the priestess arose from her throne, before
he had passed the doors, and said- "Stranger from Lacedaemon, depart
hence, and presume not to enter the holy place- it is not lawful for a
Dorian to set foot there." But he answered, "Oh! woman, I am not a
Dorian, but an Achaean." Slighting this warning, Cleomenes made his
attempt, and so he was forced to retire, together with his
Lacedaemonians. The rest were cast into prison by the Athenians, and
condemned to die- among them Timasitheus the Delphian, of whose
prowess and courage I have great things which I could tell.</p>
<p id="passage-93"><a href="#passage-93" class="passage-id">93</a> So these men died in prison. The Athenians directly afterwards
recalled Clisthenes, and the seven hundred families which Cleomenes
had driven out; and, further, they sent envoys to Sardis, to make an
alliance with the Persians, for they knew that war would follow with
Cleomenes and the Lacedaemonians. When the ambassadors reached
Sardis and delivered their message, Artaphernes, son of Hystaspes, who
was at that time governor of the Place, inquired of them "who they
were, and in what part of the world they dwelt, that they wanted to
become allies of the Persians?" The messengers told him; upon which he
answered them shortly- that "if the Athenians chose to give earth
and water to King Darius, he would conclude an alliance with them; but
if not, they might go home again." After consulting together, the
envoys, anxious to form the alliance, accepted the terms; but on their
return to Athens, they fell into deep disgrace on account of their
compliance.</p>
<p id="passage-94"><a href="#passage-94" class="passage-id">94</a> Meanwhile Cleomenes, who considered himself to have been
insulted by the Athenians both in word and deed, was drawing a force
together from all parts of the Peloponnese, without informing any
one of his object; which was to revenge himself on the Athenians,
and to establish Isagoras, who had escaped with him from the
citadel, as despot of Athens. Accordingly, with a large army, he
invaded the district of Eleusis, while the Boeotians, who had
concerted measures with him, took Oenoe and Hysiae, two country
towns upon the frontier; and at the same time the Chalcideans, on
another side, plundered divers places in Attica. The Athenians,
notwithstanding that danger threatened them from every quarter, put
off all thought of the Boeotians and Chalcideans till a future time,
and marched against the Peloponnesians, who were at Eleusis.</p>
<p id="passage-95"><a href="#passage-95" class="passage-id">95</a> As the two hosts were about to engage, first of all the
Corinthians, bethinking themselves that they were perpetrating a
wrong, changed their minds, and drew off from the main army. Then
Demaratus, son of Ariston, who was himself king of Sparta and
joint-leader of the expedition, and who till now had had no sort of
quarrel with Cleomenes, followed their example. On account of this
rupture between the kings, a law was passed at Sparta, forbidding both
monarchs to go out together with the army, as had been the custom
hitherto. The law also provided, that, as one of the kings was to be
left behind, one of the Tyndaridae should also remain at home; whereas
hitherto both had accompanied the expeditions, as auxiliaries. So when
the rest of the allies saw that the Lacedaemonian kings were not of
one mind, and that the Corinthian troops had quitted their post,
they likewise drew off and departed.</p>
<p id="passage-96"><a href="#passage-96" class="passage-id">96</a> This was the fourth time that the Dorians had invaded Attica:
twice they came as enemies, and twice they came to do good service
to the Athenian people. Their first invasion took place at the
period when they founded Megara, and is rightly placed in the reign of
Codrus at Athens; the second and third occasions were when they came
from Sparta to drive out the Pisistratidae; the fourth was the present
attack, when Cleomenes, at the head of a Peloponnesian army, entered
at Eleusis. Thus the Dorians had now four times invaded Attica.</p>
<p id="passage-97"><a href="#passage-97" class="passage-id">97</a> So when the Spartan army had broken up from its quarters thus
ingloriously, the Athenians, wishing to revenge themselves, marched
first against the Chalcideans. The Boeotians, however, advancing to
the aid of the latter as far as the Euripus, the Athenians thought
it best to attack them first. A battle was fought accordingly; and the
Athenians gained a very complete victory, killing a vast number of the
enemy, and taking seven hundred of them alive. After this, on the very
same day, they crossed into Euboea, and engaged the Chalcideans with
the like success; whereupon they left four thousand settlers upon
the lands of the Hippobotae,- which is the name the Chalcideans give
to their rich men. All the Chalcidean prisoners whom they took were
put in irons, and kept for a long time in close confinement, as
likewise were the Boeotians, until the ransom asked for them was paid;
and this the Athenians fixed at two minae the man. The chains
wherewith they were fettered the Athenians suspended in their citadel;
where they were still to be seen in my day, hanging against the wall
scorched by the Median flames, opposite the chapel which faces the
west. The Athenians made an offering of the tenth part of the
ransom-money: and expended it on the brazen chariot drawn by four
steeds, which stands on the left hand immediately that one enters
the gateway of the citadel. The inscription runs as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-98"><a href="#passage-98" class="passage-id">98</a> > When Chalcis and Boeotia dared her might,  
> Athens subdued their pride in valorous fight;  
> Gave bonds for insults; and, the ransom paid,  
> From the full tenths these steeds for Pallas made.</p>
<p id="passage-99"><a href="#passage-99" class="passage-id">99</a> Thus did the Athenians increase in strength. And it is plain
enough, not from this instance only, but from many everywhere, that
freedom is an excellent thing since even the Athenians, who, while
they continued under the rule of tyrants, were not a whit more valiant
than any of their neighbours, no sooner shook off the yoke than they
became decidedly the first of all. These things show that, while
undergoing oppression, they let themselves be beaten, since then
they worked for a master; but so soon as they got their freedom,
each man was eager to do the best he could for himself. So fared it
now with the Athenians.</p>
<p id="passage-100"><a href="#passage-100" class="passage-id">100</a> Meanwhile the Thebans, who longed to be revenged on the Athenians,
had sent to the oracle, and been told by the Pythoness that of their
own strength they would be unable to accomplish their wish: "they must
lay the matter," she said, "before the many-voiced, and ask the aid of
those nearest them." The messengers, therefore, on their return,
called a meeting, and laid the answer of the oracle before the people,
who no sooner heard the advice to "ask the aid of those nearest
them" than they exclaimed- "What! are not they who dwell the nearest
to us the men of Tanagra, of Coronaea, and Thespiae? Yet these men
always fight on our side, and have aided us with a good heart all
through the war. Of what use is it to ask them? But maybe this is
not the true meaning of the oracle."</p>
<p id="passage-101"><a href="#passage-101" class="passage-id">101</a> As they were thus discoursing one with another, a certain man,
informed of the debate, cried out-"Methinks that I understand what
course the oracle would recommend to us. Asopus, they say, had two
daughters, Thebe and Egina. The god means that, as these two were
sisters, we ought to ask the Eginetans to lend us aid." As no one
was able to hit on any better explanation, the Thebans forthwith
sent messengers to Egina, and, according to the advice of the
oracle, asked their aid, as the people "nearest to them." In answer to
this petition the Eginetans said that they would give them the
Aeacidae for helpers.</p>
<p id="passage-102"><a href="#passage-102" class="passage-id">102</a> The Thebans now, relying on the assistance of the Aeacidae,
ventured to renew the war; but they met with so rough a reception,
that they resolved to send to the Eginetans again, returning the
Aeacidae, and beseeching them to send some men instead. The Eginetans,
who were at that time a most flourishing people, elated with their
greatness, and at the same time calling to mind their ancient feud
with Athens, agreed to lend the Thebans aid, and forthwith went to war
with the Athenians, without even giving them notice by a herald. The
attention of these latter being engaged by the struggle with the
Boeotians, the Eginetans in their ships of war made descents upon
Attica, plundered Phalerum, and ravaged a vast number of the townships
upon the sea-board, whereby the Athenians suffered very grievous
damage.</p>
<p id="passage-103"><a href="#passage-103" class="passage-id">103</a> The ancient feud between the Eginetans and Athenians arose out
of the following circumstances. Once upon a time the land of Epidaurus
would bear no crops; and the Epidaurians sent to consult the oracle of
Delphi concerning their affliction. The answer bade them set up the
images of Damia and Auxesia, and promised them better fortune when
that should be done. "Shall the images be made of bronze or stone?"
the Epidaurians asked; but the Pythoness replied, "Of neither: but let
them be made of the garden olive." Then the Epidaurians sent to Athens
and asked leave to cut olive wood in Attica, believing the Athenian
olives to be the holiest; or, according to others, because there
were no olives at that time anywhere else in all the world but at
Athens.' The Athenians answered that they would give them leave, but
on condition of their bringing offerings year by year to Minerva
Polias and to Erechtheus. The Epidaurians agreed, and having
obtained what they wanted, made the images of olive wood, and set them
up in their own country. Henceforth their land bore its crops; and
they duly paid the Athenians what had been agreed upon.</p>
<p id="passage-104"><a href="#passage-104" class="passage-id">104</a> Anciently, and even down to the time when this took place, the
Eginetans were in all things subject to the Epidaurians, and had to
cross over to Epidaurus for the trial of all suits in which they
were engaged one with another. After this, however, the Eginetans
built themselves ships, and, growing proud, revolted from the
Epidaurians. Having thus come to be at enmity with them, the
Eginetans, who were masters of the sea, ravaged Epidaurus, and even
carried off these very images of Damia and Auxesia, which they set
up in their own country, in the interior, at a place called Oea, about
twenty furlongs from their city. This done, they fixed a worship for
the images, which consisted in part of sacrifices, in part of female
satiric choruses; while at the same time they appointed certain men to
furnish the choruses, ten for each goddess. These choruses did not
abuse men, but only the women of the country. Holy orgies of a similar
kind were in use also among the Epidaurians, and likewise another sort
of holy orgies, whereof it is not lawful to speak.</p>
<p id="passage-105"><a href="#passage-105" class="passage-id">105</a> After the robbery of the images the Epidaurians ceased to make the
stipulated payments to the Athenians, wherefore the Athenians sent
to Epidaurus to remonstrate. But the Epidaurians proved to them that
they were not guilty of any wrong:-"While the images continued in
their country," they said, "they had duly paid the offerings according
to the agreement; now that the images had been taken from them, they
were no longer under any obligation to pay: the Athenians should
make their demand of the Eginetans, in whose possession the figures
now were." Upon this the Athenians sent to Egina, and demanded the
images back; but the Eginetans answered that the Athenians had nothing
whatever to do with them.</p>
<p id="passage-106"><a href="#passage-106" class="passage-id">106</a> After this the Athenians relate that they sent a trireme to
Egina with certain citizens on board, and that these men, who bore
commission from the state, landed in Egina, and sought to take the
images away, considering them to be their own, inasmuch as they were
made of their wood. And first they endeavoured to wrench them from
their pedestals, and so carry them off; but failing herein, they in
the next place tied ropes to them, and set to work to try if they
could haul them down. In the midst of their hauling suddenly there was
a thunderclap, and with the thunderclap an earthquake; and the crew of
the trireme were forthwith seized with madness, and, like enemies,
began to kill one another; until at last there was but one left, who
returned alone to Phalerum.</p>
<p id="passage-107"><a href="#passage-107" class="passage-id">107</a> Such is the account given by the Athenians. The Eginetans deny
that there was only a single vessel- "Had there been only one," they
say, "or no more than a few, they would easily have repulsed the
attack, even if they had had no fleet at all; but the Athenians came
against them with a large number of ships, wherefore they gave way,
and did not hazard a battle." They do not however explain clearly
whether it was from a conviction of their own inferiority at sea
that they yielded, or whether it was for the purpose of doing that
which in fact they did. Their account is that the Athenians,
disembarking from their ships, when they found that no resistance
was offered, made for the statues, and failing to wrench them from
their pedestals, tied ropes to them and began to haul. Then, they say-
and some people will perhaps believe them, though I for my part do
not- the two statues, as they were being dragged and hauled, fell down
both upon their knees; in which attitude they still remain. Such,
according to them, was the conduct of the Athenians; they meanwhile,
having learnt beforehand what was intended, had prevailed on the
Argives to hold themselves in readiness; and the Athenians accordingly
were but just landed on their coasts when the Argives came to their
aid. Secretly and silently they crossed over from Epidaurus, and,
before the Athenians were aware, cut off their retreat to their ships,
and fell upon them; and the thunder came exactly at that moment, and
the earthquake with it.</p>
<p id="passage-108"><a href="#passage-108" class="passage-id">108</a> The Argives and the Eginetans both agree in giving this account;
and the Athenians themselves acknowledge that but one of their men
returned alive to Attica. According to the Argives, he escaped from
the battle in which the rest of the Athenian troops were destroyed
by them. According to the Athenians, it was the god who destroyed
their troops; and even this one man did not escape, for he perished in
the following manner. When he came back to Athens, bringing word of
the calamity, the wives of those who had been sent out on the
expedition took it sorely to heart that he alone should have
survived the slaughter of all the rest;- they therefore crowded
round the man, and struck him with the brooches by which their dresses
were fastened each, as she struck, asking him where he had left her
husband. And the man died in this way. The Athenians thought the
deed of the women more horrible even than the fate of the troops; as
however they did not know how else to punish them, they changed
their dress and compelled them to wear the costume of the Ionians.
Till this time the Athenian women had worn a Dorian dress, shaped
nearly like that which prevails at Corinth. Henceforth they were
made to wear the linen tunic, which does not require brooches.</p>
<p id="passage-109"><a href="#passage-109" class="passage-id">109</a> In very truth, however, this dress is not originally Ionian, but
Carian; for anciently the Greek women all wore the costume which is
now called the Dorian. It is said further that the Argives and
Eginetans made it a custom, on this same account, for their women to
wear brooches half as large again as formerly, and to offer brooches
rather than anything else in the temple of these goddesses. They
also forbade the bringing of anything Attic into the temple, were it
even a jar of earthenware, and made a law that none but native
drinking vessels should be used there in time to come. From this early
age to my own day the Argive and Eginetan women have always
continued to wear their brooches larger than formerly, through
hatred of the Athenians.</p>
<p id="passage-110"><a href="#passage-110" class="passage-id">110</a> Such then was the origin of the feud which existed between the
Eginetans and the Athenians. Hence, when the Thebans made their
application for succour, the Eginetans, calling to mind the matter
of images, gladly lent their aid to the Boeotians. They ravaged all
the sea-coast of Attica; and the Athenians were about to attack them
in return, when they were stopped by the oracle of Delphi, which
bade them wait till thirty years had passed from the time that the
Eginetans did the wrong, and in the thirty-first year, having first
set apart a precinct for Aeacus, then to begin the war. "So should
they succeed to their wish," the oracle said; "but if they went to war
at once, though they would still conquer the island in the end, yet
they must go through much suffering and much exertion before taking
it." On receiving this warning the Athenians set apart a precinct
for Aeacus- the same which still remains dedicated to him in their
market-place- but they could not hear with any patience of waiting
thirty years, after they had suffered such grievous wrong at the hands
of the Eginetans.</p>
<p id="passage-111"><a href="#passage-111" class="passage-id">111</a> Accordingly they were making ready to take their revenge when a
fresh stir on the part of the Lacedaemonians hindered their
projects. These last had become aware of the truth- how that the
Alcmaeonidae had practised on the Pythoness, and the Pythoness had
schemed against themselves, and against the Pisistratidae; and the
discovery was a double grief to them, for while they had driven
their own sworn friends into exile, they found that they had not
gained thereby a particle of good will from Athens. They were also
moved by certain prophecies, which declared that many dire
calamities should befall them at the hands of the Athenians. Of
these in times past they had been ignorant; but now they had become
acquainted with them by means of Cleomenes, who had brought them
with him to Sparta, having found them in the Athenian citadel, where
they had been left by the Pisistratidae when they were driven from
Athens: they were in the temple, and Cleomenes having discovered them,
carried them off.</p>
<p id="passage-112"><a href="#passage-112" class="passage-id">112</a> So when the Lacedaemonians obtained possession of the
prophecies, and saw that the Athenians were growing in strength, and
had no mind to acknowledge any subjection to their control, it
occurred to them that, if the people of Attica were free, they would
be likely to be as powerful as themselves, but if they were
oppressed by a tyranny, they would be weak and submissive. Under
this feeling they sent and recalled Hippias, the son of Pisistratus,
from Sigeum upon the Hellespont, where the Pisistratidae had taken
shelter. Hippias came at their bidding, and the Spartans on his
arrival summoned deputies from all their other allies, and thus
addressed the assembly:-</p>
<p id="passage-113"><a href="#passage-113" class="passage-id">113</a> "Friends and brothers in arms, we are free to confess that we
did lately a thing which was not right. Misled by counterfeit oracles,
we drove from their country those who were our sworn and true friends,
and who had, moreover, engaged to keep Athens in dependence upon us;
and we delivered the government into the hands of an unthankful
people- a people who no sooner got their freedom by our means, and
grew in power, than they turned us and our king, with every token of
insult, out of their city. Since then they have gone on continually
raising their thoughts higher, as their neighbours of Boeotia and
Chalcis have already discovered to their cost, and as others too
will presently discover if they shall offend them. Having thus
erred, we will endeavour now, with your help, to remedy the evils we
have caused, and to obtain vengeance on the Athenians. For this
cause we have sent for Hippias to come here, and have summoned you
likewise from your several states, that we may all now with heart
and hand unite to restore him to Athens, and thereby give him back
that which we took from him formerly."</p>
<p id="passage-114"><a href="#passage-114" class="passage-id">114</a> (SS 1.) Such was the address of the Spartans. The greater number
of the allies listened without being persuaded. None however broke
silence but Sosicles the Corinthian, who exclaimed-</p>
<p id="passage-115"><a href="#passage-115" class="passage-id">115</a> "Surely the heaven will soon be below, and the earth above, and
men will henceforth live in the sea, and fish take their place upon
the dry land, since you, Lacedaemonians, propose to put down free
governments in the cities of Greece, and to set up tyrannies in
their room. There is nothing in the whole world so unjust, nothing
so bloody, as a tyranny. If, however, it seems to you a desirable
thing to have the cities under despotic rule, begin by putting a
tyrant over yourselves, and then establish despots in the other
states. While you continue yourselves, as you have always been,
unacquainted with tyranny, and take such excellent care that Sparta
may not suffer from it, to act as you are now doing is to treat your
allies unworthily. If you knew what tyranny was as well as
ourselves, you would be better advised than you now are in regard to
it. (SS 2.) The government at Corinth was once an oligarchy - a single
race, called Bacchiadae, who intermarried only among themselves,
held the management of affairs. Now it happened that Amphion, one of
these, had a daughter, named Labda, who was lame, and whom therefore
none of the Bacchiadae would consent to marry; so she was taken to
wife by Aetion, son of Echecrates, a man of the township of Petra, who
was, however, by descent of the race of the Lapithae, and of the house
of Caeneus. Aetion, as he had no child, either by this wife or by
any other, went to Delphi to consult the oracle concerning the matter.
Scarcely had he entered the temple when the Pythoness saluted him in
these words-</p>
<p id="passage-116"><a href="#passage-116" class="passage-id">116</a> > No one honours thee now, Aetion, worthy of honour-  
> Labda shall soon be a mother- her offspring a rock, that will
>   one day  
> Fall on the kingly race, and right the city of Corinth.</p>
<p id="passage-117"><a href="#passage-117" class="passage-id">117</a> By some chance this address of the oracle to Aetion came to the ears
of the Bacchiadae, who till then had been unable to perceive the
meaning of another earlier prophecy which likewise bore upon
Corinth, and pointed to the same event as Aetion's prediction. It
was the following:-</p>
<p id="passage-118"><a href="#passage-118" class="passage-id">118</a> > When mid the rocks an eagle shall bear a carnivorous lion,  
> Mighty and fierce, he shall loosen the limbs of many beneath them-
>
> Brood ye well upon this, all ye Corinthian people,  
> Ye who dwell by fair Peirene, and beetling Corinth.</p>
<p id="passage-119"><a href="#passage-119" class="passage-id">119</a> (SS 3.) The Bacchiadae had possessed this oracle for some time;
but they were quite at a loss to know what it meant until they heard
the response given to Aetion; then however they at once perceived
its meaning, since the two agreed so well together. Nevertheless,
though the bearing of the first prophecy was now clear to them, they
remained quiet, being minded to put to death the child which Aetion
was expecting. As soon, therefore, as his wife was delivered, they
sent ten of their number to the township where Aetion lived, with
orders to make away with the baby. So the men came to Petra, and
went into Aetion's house, and there asked if they might see the child;
and Labda, who knew nothing of their purpose, but thought their
inquiries arose from a kindly feeling towards her husband, brought the
child, and laid him in the arms of one of them. Now they had agreed by
the way that whoever first got hold of the child should dash it
against the ground. It happened, however, by a providential chance,
that the babe, just as Labda put him into the man's arms, smiled in
his face. The man saw the smile, and was touched with pity, so that he
could not kill it; he therefore passed it on to his next neighbour,
who gave it to a third; and so it went through all the ten without any
one choosing to be the murderer. The mother received her child back;
and the men went out of the house, and stood near the door, and
there blamed and reproached one another; chiefly however accusing
the man who had first had the child in his arms, because he had not
done as had been agreed upon. At last, after much time had been thus
spent, they resolved to go into the house again and all take part in
the murder. (SS 4.) But it was fated that evil should come upon
Corinth from the progeny of Aetion; and so it chanced that Labda, as
she stood near the door, heard all that the men said to one another,
and fearful of their changing their mind, and returning to destroy her
baby, she carried him off and hid him in what seemed to her the most
unlikely place to be suspected, viz., a 'cypsel' or corn-bin. She knew
that if they came back to look for the child, they would search all
her house; and so indeed they did, but not finding the child after
looking everywhere, they thought it best to go away, and declare to
those by whom they had been sent that they had done their bidding. And
thus they reported on their return home. (SS 5.) Aetion's son grew up,
and, in remembrance of the danger from which he had escaped, was named
Cypselus, after the cornbin. When he reached to man's estate, he
went to Delphi, and on consulting the oracle, received a response
which was two-sided. It was the following:</p>
<p id="passage-120"><a href="#passage-120" class="passage-id">120</a> > See there comes to my dwelling a man much favour'd of fortune,
> Cypselus, son of Aetion, and king of the glorious Corinth-
> He and his children too, but not his children's children.</p>
<p id="passage-121"><a href="#passage-121" class="passage-id">121</a> Such was the oracle; and Cypselus put so much faith in it that he
forthwith made his attempt, and thereby became master of Corinth.
Having thus got the tyranny, he showed himself a harsh ruler- many
of the Corinthians he drove into banishment, many he deprived of their
fortunes, and a still greater number of their lives. (SS 6.) His reign
lasted thirty years, and was prosperous to its close; insomuch that he
left the government to Periander, his son. This prince at the
beginning of his reign was of a milder temper than his father; but
after he corresponded by means of messengers with Thrasybulus,
tyrant of Miletus, he became even more sanguinary. On one occasion
he sent a herald to ask Thrasybulus what mode of government it was
safest to set up in order to rule with honour. Thrasybulus led the
messenger without the city, and took him into a field of corn, through
which he began to walk, while he asked him again and again
concerning his coming from Corinth, ever as he went breaking off and
throwing away all such ears of corn as over-topped the rest. In this
way he went through the whole field, and destroyed all the best and
richest part of the crop; then, without a word, he sent the
messenger back. On the return of the man to Corinth, Periander was
eager to know what Thrasybulus had counselled, but the messenger
reported that he had said nothing; and he wondered that Periander
had sent him to so strange a man, who seemed to have lost his
senses, since he did nothing but destroy his own property. And upon
this he told how Thrasybulus had behaved at the interview. (SS 7.)
Periander, perceiving what the action meant, and knowing that
Thrasybulus advised the destruction of all the leading citizens,
treated his subjects from this time forward with the very greatest
cruelty. Where Cypselus had spared any, and had neither put them to
death nor banished them, Periander completed what his father had
left unfinished. One day he stripped all the women of Corinth stark
naked, for the sake of his own wife Melissa. He had sent messengers
into Thesprotia to consult the oracle of the dead upon the Acheron
concerning a pledge which had been given into his charge by a
stranger, and Melissa appeared, but refused to speak or tell where the
pledge was- 'she was chill,' she said, 'having no clothes; the
garments buried with her were of no manner of use, since they had
not been burnt. And this should be her token to Periander, that what
she said was true- the oven was cold when he baked his loaves in
it.' When this message was brought him, Periander knew the token;
wherefore he straightway made proclamation, that all the wives of
the Corinthians should go forth to the temple of Juno. So the women
apparelled themselves in their bravest, and went forth, as if to a
festival. Then, with the help of his guards, whom he had placed for
the purpose, he stripped them one and all, making no difference
between the free women and the slaves; and, taking their clothes to
a pit, he called on the name of Melissa, and burnt the whole heap.
This done, he sent a second time to the oracle; and Melissa's ghost
told him where he would find the stranger's pledge. Such, O
Lacedaemonians! is tyranny, and such are the deeds which spring from
it. We Corinthians marvelled greatly when we first knew of your having
sent for Hippias; and now it surprises us still more to hear you speak
as you do. We adjure you, by the common gods of Greece, plant not
despots in her cities. If however you are determined, if you
persist, against all justice, in seeking to restore Hippias- know,
at least, that the Corinthians will not approve your conduct."</p>
<p id="passage-122"><a href="#passage-122" class="passage-id">122</a> When Sosicles, the deputy from Corinth, had thus spoken, Hippias
replied, and, invoking the same gods, he said-"Of a surety the
Corinthians will, beyond all others, regret the Pisistratidae, when
the fated days come for them to be distressed by the Athenians."
Hippias spoke thus because he knew the prophecies better than any
man living. But the rest of the allies, who till Sosicles spoke had
remained quiet, when they heard him utter his thoughts thus boldly,
all together broke silence, and declared themselves of the same
mind; and withal, they conjured the Lacedaemonians "not to
revolutionise a Grecian city." And in this way the enterprise came
to nought.</p>
<p id="passage-123"><a href="#passage-123" class="passage-id">123</a> Hippias hereupon withdrew; and Amyntas the Macedonian offered
him the city of Anthemus, while the Thessalians were willing to give
him Iolcos: but he would accept neither the one nor the other,
preferring to go back to Sigeum, which city Pisistratus had taken by
force of arms from the Mytilenaeans. Pisistratus, when he became
master of the place, established there as tyrant his own natural
son, Hegesistratus, whose mother was an Argive woman. But this
prince was not allowed to enjoy peaceably what his father had made
over to him; for during very many years there had been war between the
Athenians of Sigeum and the Mytilenaeans of the city called Achilleum.
They of Mytilene insisted on having the place restored to them: but
the Athenians refused, since they argued that the Aeolians had no
better claim to the Trojan territory than themselves, or than any of
the other Greeks who helped Menelaus on occasion of the rape of Helen.</p>
<p id="passage-124"><a href="#passage-124" class="passage-id">124</a> War accordingly continued, with many and various incidents,
whereof the following was one. In a battle which was gained by the
Athenians, the poet Alcaeus took to flight, and saved himself, but
lost his arms, which fell into the hands of the conquerors. They
hung them up in the temple of Minerva at Sigeum; and Alcaeus made a
poem, describing his misadventure to his friend Melanippus, and sent
it to him at Mytilene. The Mytilenaeans and Athenians were
reconciled by Periander, the son of Cypselus, who was chosen by both
parties as arbiter- he decided that they should each retain that of
which they were at the time possessed; and Sigeum passed in this way
under the dominion of Athens.</p>
<p id="passage-125"><a href="#passage-125" class="passage-id">125</a> On the return of Hippias to Asia from Lacedaemon, he moved
heaven and earth to set Artaphernes against the Athenians, and did all
that lay in his power to bring Athens into subjection to himself and
Darius. So when the Athenians learnt what he was about, they sent
envoys to Sardis, and exhorted the Persians not to lend an ear to
the Athenian exiles. Artaphernes told them in reply, "that if they
wished to remain safe, they must receive back Hippias." The Athenians,
when this answer was reported to them, determined not to consent,
and therefore made up their minds to be at open enmity with the
Persians.</p>
<p id="passage-126"><a href="#passage-126" class="passage-id">126</a> The Athenians had come to this decision, and were already in bad
odour with the Persians, when Aristagoras the Milesian, dismissed from
Sparta by Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian, arrived at Athens. He knew
that, after Sparta, Athens was the most powerful of the Grecian
states. Accordingly he appeared before the people, and, as he had done
at Sparta, spoke to them of the good things which there were in
Asia, and of the Persian mode of fight- how they used neither shield
nor spear, and were very easy to conquer. All this he urged, and
reminded them also that Miletus was a colony from Athens, and
therefore ought to receive their succour, since they were so powerful-
and in the earnestness of his entreaties, he cared little what he
promised- till, at the last, he prevailed and won them over. It
seems indeed to be easier to deceive a multitude than one man- for
Aristagoras, though he failed to impose on Cleomenes the
Lacedaemonian, succeeded with the Athenians, who were thirty thousand.
Won by his persuasions, they voted that twenty ships should be sent to
the aid of the Ionians, under the command of Melanthius, one of the
citizens, a man of mark in every way. These ships were the beginning
of mischief both to the Greeks and to the barbarians.</p>
<p id="passage-127"><a href="#passage-127" class="passage-id">127</a> Aristagoras sailed away in advance, and when he reached Miletus,
devised a plan, from which no manner of advantage could possibly
accrue to the Ionians;- indeed, in forming it, he did not aim at their
benefit, but his sole wish was to annoy King Darius. He sent a
messenger into Phrygia to those Paeonians who had been led away
captive by Megabazus from the river Strymon, and who now dwelt by
themselves in Phrygia, having a tract of land and a hamlet of their
own. This man, when he reached the Paeonians, spoke thus to them:-</p>
<p id="passage-128"><a href="#passage-128" class="passage-id">128</a> "Men of Paeonia, Aristagoras, king of Miletus, has sent me to you,
to inform you that you may now escape, if you choose to follow the
advice he proffers. All Ionia has revolted from the king; and the
way is open to you to return to your own land. You have only to
contrive to reach the sea-coast; the rest shall be our business."</p>
<p id="passage-129"><a href="#passage-129" class="passage-id">129</a> When the Paeonians heard this, they were exceedingly rejoiced,
and, taking with them their wives and children, they made all speed to
the coast; a few only remaining in Phrygia through fear. The rest,
having reached the sea, crossed over to Chios, where they had just
landed, when a great troop of Persian horse came following upon
their heels, and seeking to overtake them. Not succeeding, however,
they sent a message across to Chios, and begged the Paeonians to
come back again. These last refused, and were conveyed by the Chians
from Chios to Lesbos, and by the Lesbians thence to Doriscus; from
which place they made their way on foot to Paeonia.</p>
<p id="passage-130"><a href="#passage-130" class="passage-id">130</a> The Athenians now arrived with a fleet of twenty sail, and brought
also in their company five triremes of the Eretrians; which had joined
the expedition, not so much out of goodwill towards Athens, as to
pay a debt which they already owed to the people of Miletus. For in
the old war between the Chalcideans and Eretrians, the Milesians
fought on the Eretrian side throughout, while the Chalcideans had
the help of the Samian people. Aristagoras, on their arrival,
assembled the rest of his allies, and proceeded to attack Sardis,
not however leading the army in person, but appointing to the
command his own brother Charopinus and Hermophantus, one of the
citizens, while he himself remained behind in Miletus.</p>
<p id="passage-131"><a href="#passage-131" class="passage-id">131</a> The Ionians sailed with this fleet to Ephesus, and, leaving
their ships at Coressus in the Ephesian territory, took guides from
the city, and went up the country with a great host. They marched
along the course of the river Cayster, and, crossing over the ridge of
Tmolus, came down upon Sardis and took it, no man opposing them;-
the whole city fell into their hands, except only the citadel, which
Artaphernes defended in person, having with him no contemptible force.</p>
<p id="passage-132"><a href="#passage-132" class="passage-id">132</a> Though, however, they took the city, they did not succeed in
plundering it; for, as the houses in Sardis were most of them built of
reeds, and even the few which were of brick had a reed thatching for
their roof, one of them was no sooner fired by a soldier than the
flames ran speedily from house to house, and spread over the whole
place. As the fire raged, the Lydians and such Persians as were in the
city, inclosed on every side by the flames, which had seized all the
skirts of the town, and finding themselves unable to get out, came
in crowds into the market-place, and gathered themselves upon the
banks of the Pactolus This stream, which comes down from Mount Tmolus,
and brings the Sardians a quantity of gold-dust, runs directly through
the market place of Sardis, and joins the Hermus, before that river
reaches the sea. So the Lydians and Persians, brought together in this
way in the market-place and about the Pactolus, were forced to stand
on their defence; and the Ionians, when they saw the enemy in part
resisting, in part pouring towards them in dense crowds, took
fright, and drawing off to the ridge which is called Tmolus when night
came, went back to their ships.</p>
<p id="passage-133"><a href="#passage-133" class="passage-id">133</a> Sardis however was burnt, and, among other buildings, a temple
of the native goddess Cybele was destroyed; which was the reason
afterwards alleged by the Persians for setting on fire the temples
of the Greeks. As soon as what had happened was known, all the
Persians who were stationed on this side the Halys drew together,
and brought help to the Lydians. Finding however, when they arrived,
that the Ionians had already withdrawn from Sardis, they set off, and,
following close upon their track, came up with them at Ephesus. The
Ionians drew out against them in battle array; and a fight ensued,
wherein the Greeks had very greatly the worse. Vast numbers were slain
by the Persians: among other men of note, they killed the captain of
the Eretrians, a certain Eualcidas, a man who had gained crowns at the
Games, and received much praise from Simonides the Cean. Such as
made their escape from the battle, dispersed among the several cities.</p>
<p id="passage-134"><a href="#passage-134" class="passage-id">134</a> So ended this encounter. Afterwards the Athenians quite forsook
the Ionians, and, though Aristagoras besought them much by his
ambassadors, refused to give him any further help. Still the
Ionians, notwithstanding this desertion, continued unceasingly their
preparations to carry on the war against the Persian king, which their
late conduct towards him had rendered unavoidable. Sailing into the
Hellespont, they brought Byzantium, and all the other cities in that
quarter, under their sway. Again, quitting the Hellespont, they went
to Caria, and won the greater part of the Carians to their side; while
Caunus, which had formerly refused to join with them, after the
burning of Sardis, came over likewise.</p>
<p id="passage-135"><a href="#passage-135" class="passage-id">135</a> All the Cyprians too, excepting those of Amathus, of their own
proper motion espoused the Ionian cause. The occasion of their
revolting from the Medes was the following. There was a certain
Onesilus, younger brother of Gorgus, king of Salamis, and son of
Chersis, who was son of Siromus, and grandson of Evelthon. This man
had often in former times entreated Gorgus to rebel against the
king; but, when he heard of the revolt of the Ionians, he left him
no peace with his importunity. As, however, Gorgus would not hearken
to him, he watched his occasion, and when his brother had gone outside
the town, he with his partisans closed the gates upon him. Gorgus,
thus deprived of his city, fled to the Medes; and Onesilus, being
now king of Salamis, sought to bring about a revolt of the whole of
Cyprus. All were prevailed on except the Amathusians, who refused to
listen to him; whereupon Onesilus sate down before Amathus, and laid
siege to it.</p>
<p id="passage-136"><a href="#passage-136" class="passage-id">136</a> While Onesilus was engaged in the siege of Amathus, King Darius
received tidings of the taking and burning of Sardis by the
Athenians and Ionians; and at the same time he learnt that the
author of the league, the man by whom the whole matter had been
Planned and contrived, was Aristagoras the Milesian. It is said that
he no sooner understood what had happened, than, laying aside all
thought concerning the Ionians, who would, he was sure, pay dear for
their rebellion, he asked, "Who the Athenians were?" and, being
informed, called for his bow, and placing an arrow on the string, shot
upward into the sky, saying, as he let fly the shaft- "Grant me,
Jupiter, to revenge myself on the Athenians!" After this speech, he
bade one of his servants every day, when his dinner was spread,
three times repeat these words to him- "Master, remember the
Athenians."</p>
<p id="passage-137"><a href="#passage-137" class="passage-id">137</a> Then he summoned into his presence Histiaeus if Miletus, whom he
had kept at his court for so long a time; and on his appearance
addressed him thus "I am told, O Histiaeus, that thy lieutenant, to
whom thou hast given Miletus in charge, has raised a rebellion against
me. He has brought men from the other continent to contend with me,
and, prevailing on the Ionians- whose conduct I shall know how to
recompense- to join with this force, he has robbed me of Sardis! Is
this as it should be, thinkest thou Or can it have been done without
thy knowledge and advice? Beware lest it be found hereafter that the
blame of these acts is thine."</p>
<p id="passage-138"><a href="#passage-138" class="passage-id">138</a> Histiaeus answered- "What words are these, O king, to which thou
hast given utterance? I advise aught from which unpleasantness of
any kind, little or great, should come to thee! What could I gain by
so doing? Or what is there that I lack now? Have I not all that thou
hast, and am I not thought worthy to partake all thy counsels? If my
lieutenant has indeed done as thou sayest, be sure he has done it
all of his own head. For my part, I do not think it can really be that
the Milesians and my lieutenant have raised a rebellion against
thee. But if they have indeed committed aught to thy hurt, and the
tidings are true which have come to thee, judge thou how ill-advised
thou wert to remove me from the sea-coast. The Ionians, it seems, have
waited till I was no longer in sight, and then sought to execute
that which they long ago desired; whereas, if I had been there, not
a single city would have stirred. Suffer me then to hasten at my
best speed to Ionia, that I may place matters there upon their
former footing, and deliver up to thee the deputy of Miletus, who
has caused all the troubles. Having managed this business to thy
heart's content, I swear by all the gods of thy royal house, I will
not put off the clothes in which I reach Ionia till I have made
Sardinia, the biggest island in the world, thy tributary."</p>
<p id="passage-139"><a href="#passage-139" class="passage-id">139</a> Histiaeus spoke thus, wishing to deceive the king; and Darius,
persuaded by his words, let him go; only bidding him be sure to do
as he had promised, and afterwards come back to Susa.</p>
<p id="passage-140"><a href="#passage-140" class="passage-id">140</a> In the meantime- while the tidings of the burning of Sardis were
reaching the king, and Darius was shooting the arrow and having the
conference with Histiaeus, and the latter, by permission of Darius,
was hastening down to the sea- in Cyprus the following events took
place. Tidings came to Onesilus, the Salaminian, who was still
besieging Amathus, that a certain Artybius, a Persian, was looked
for to arrive in Cyprus with a great Persian armament. So Onesilus,
when the news reached him, sent off heralds to all parts of Ionia, and
besought the Ionians to give him aid. After brief deliberation,
these last in full force passed over into the island; and the Persians
about the same time crossed in their ships from Cilicia, and proceeded
by land to attack Salamis; while the Phoenicians, with the fleet,
sailed round the promontory which goes by the name of "the Keys of
Cyprus."</p>
<p id="passage-141"><a href="#passage-141" class="passage-id">141</a> In this posture of affairs the princes of Cyprus called together
the captains of the Ionians, and thus addressed them:-</p>
<p id="passage-142"><a href="#passage-142" class="passage-id">142</a> "Men of Ionia, we Cyprians leave it to you to choose whether you
will fight with the Persians or with the Phoenicians. If it be your
pleasure to try your strength on land against the Persians, come on
shore at once, and array yourselves for the battle; we will then
embark aboard your ships and engage the Phoenicians by sea. If, on the
other hand, ye prefer to encounter the Phoenicians, let that be your
task: only be sure, whichever part you choose, to acquit yourselves so
that Ionia and Cyprus, so far as depends on you, may preserve their
freedom."</p>
<p id="passage-143"><a href="#passage-143" class="passage-id">143</a> The Ionians made answer- "The commonwealth of Ionia sent us here
to guard the sea, not to make over our ships to you, and engage with
the Persians on shore. We will therefore keep the post which has
been assigned to us, and seek therein to be of some service. Do you,
remembering what you suffered when you were the slaves of the Medes,
behave like brave warriors."</p>
<p id="passage-144"><a href="#passage-144" class="passage-id">144</a> Such was the reply of the Ionians. Not long afterwards the
Persians advanced into the plain before Salamis, and the Cyprian kings
ranged their troops in order of battle against them, placing them so
that while the rest of the Cyprians were drawn up against the
auxiliaries of the enemy, the choicest troops of the Salaminians and
the Solians were set to oppose the Persians. At the same time
Onesilus, of his own accord, took post opposite to Artybius, the
Persian general.</p>
<p id="passage-145"><a href="#passage-145" class="passage-id">145</a> Now Artybius rode a horse which had been trained to rear up
against a foot-soldier. Onesilus, informed of this, called to him
his shield-bearer, who was a Carian by nation, a man well skilled in
war, and of daring courage; and thus addressed him:- "I hear," he
said, "that the horse which Artybius rides, rears up and attacks
with his fore legs and teeth the man against whom his rider urges him.
Consider quickly therefore and tell me which wilt thou undertake to
encounter, the steed or the rider?" Then the squire answered him,
"Both, my liege, or either, am I ready to undertake, and there is
nothing that I will shrink from at thy bidding. But I will tell thee
what seems to me to make most for thy interests. As thou art a
prince and a general, I think thou shouldest engage with one who is
himself both a prince and also a general. For then, if thou slayest
thine adversary, 'twill redound to thine honour, and if he slays
thee (which may Heaven forefend!), yet to fall by the hand of a worthy
foe makes death lose half its horror. To us, thy followers, leave
his war-horse and his retinue. And have thou no fear of the horse's
tricks. I warrant that this is the last time he will stand up
against any one."</p>
<p id="passage-146"><a href="#passage-146" class="passage-id">146</a> Thus spake the Carian; and shortly after, the two hosts joined
battle both by sea and land. And here it chanced that by sea the
Ionians, who that day fought as they have never done either before
or since, defeated the Phoenicians, the Samians especially
distinguishing themselves. Meanwhile the combat had begun on land, and
the two armies were engaged in a sharp struggle, when thus it fell out
in the matter of the generals. Artybius, astride upon his horse,
charged down upon Onesilus, who, as he had agreed with his
shield-bearer, aimed his blow at the rider; the horse reared and
placed his fore feet upon the shield of Onesilus, when the Carian
cut at him with a reaping-hook, and severed the two legs from the
body. The horse fell upon the spot, and Artybius, the Persian general,
with him.</p>
<p id="passage-147"><a href="#passage-147" class="passage-id">147</a> In the thick of the fight, Stesanor, tyrant of Curium, who
commanded no inconsiderable body of troops, went over with them to the
enemy. On this desertion of the Curians- Argive colonists, if report
says true- forthwith the war-chariots of the Salaminians followed
the example set them, and went over likewise; whereupon victory
declared in favour of the Persians; and the army of the Cyprians being
routed, vast numbers were slain, and among them Onesilus, the son of
Chersis, who was the author of the revolt, and Aristocyprus, king of
the Solians. This Aristocyprus was son of Philocyprus, whom Solon
the Athenian, when he visited Cyprus, praised in his poems beyond
all other sovereigns.</p>
<p id="passage-148"><a href="#passage-148" class="passage-id">148</a> The Amathusians, because Onesilus had laid siege to their town,
cut the head off his corpse, and took it with them to Amathus, where
it was set up over the gates. Here it hung till it became hollow;
whereupon a swarm of bees took possession of it, and filled it with
a honeycomb. On seeing this the Amathusians consulted the oracle,
and were commanded "to take down the head and bury it, and thenceforth
to regard Onesilus as a hero, and offer sacrifice to him year by year;
so it would go the better with them." And to this day the
Amathusians do as they were then bidden.</p>
<p id="passage-149"><a href="#passage-149" class="passage-id">149</a> As for the Ionians who had gained the sea-fight, when they found
that the affairs of Onesilus were utterly lost and ruined, and that
siege was laid to all the cities of Cyprus excepting Salamis, which
the inhabitants had surrendered to Gorgus, the former king,
forthwith they left Cyprus, and sailed away home. Of the cities
which were besieged, Soli held out the longest: the Persians took it
by undermining the wall in the fifth month from the beginning of the
siege.</p>
<p id="passage-150"><a href="#passage-150" class="passage-id">150</a> Thus, after enjoying a year of freedom, the Cyprians were enslaved
for the second time. Meanwhile Daurises, who was married to one of the
daughters of Darius, together with Hymeas, Otanes, and other Persian
captains, who were likewise married to daughters of the king, after
pursuing the Ionians who had fought at Sardis, defeating them, and
driving them to their ships, divided their efforts against the
different cities, and proceeded in succession to take and sack each
one of them.</p>
<p id="passage-151"><a href="#passage-151" class="passage-id">151</a> Daurises attacked the towns upon the Hellespont, and took in as
many days the five cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus, and
Paesus. From Paesus he marched against Parium; but on his way
receiving intelligence that the Carians had made common cause with the
Ionians, and thrown off the Persian yoke, he turned round, and,
leaving the Hellespont, marched away towards Caria.</p>
<p id="passage-152"><a href="#passage-152" class="passage-id">152</a> The Carians by some chance got information of this movement before
Daurises arrived, and drew together their strength to a place called
"the White Columns," which is on the river Marsyas, a stream running
from the Idrian country, and emptying itself into the Maeander. Here
when they were met, many plans were put forth; but the best, in my
judgment, was that of Pixodarus, the son of Mausolus, a Cindyan, who
was married to a daughter of Syennesis, the Cilician king. His
advice was that the Carians should cross the Maeander, and fight
with the river at their back; that so, all chance of flight being
cut off, they might be forced to stand their ground, and have their
natural courage raised to a still higher pitch. His opinion,
however, did not prevail; it was thought best to make the enemy have
the Maeander behind them; that so, if they were defeated in the battle
and put to flight, they might have no retreat open, but be driven
headlong into the river.</p>
<p id="passage-153"><a href="#passage-153" class="passage-id">153</a> The Persians soon afterwards approached, and, crossing the
Maeander, engaged the Carians upon the banks of the Marsyas; where for
a long time the battle was stoutly contested, but at last the
Carians were defeated, being overpowered by numbers. On the side of
the Persians there fell 2000, while the Carians had not fewer than
10,000 slain. Such as escaped from the field of battle collected
together at Labranda, in the vast precinct of Jupiter Stratius- a
deity worshipped only by the Carians- and in the sacred grove of
plane-trees. Here they deliberated as to the best means of saving
themselves, doubting whether they would fare better if they gave
themselves up to the Persians, or if they abandoned Asia for ever.</p>
<p id="passage-154"><a href="#passage-154" class="passage-id">154</a> As they were debating these matters a body of Milesians and allies
came to their assistance; whereupon the Carians, dismissing their
former thoughts, prepared themselves afresh for war, and on the
approach of the Persians gave them battle a second time. They were
defeated, however, with still greater loss than before; and while
all the troops engaged suffered severely, the blow fell with most
force on the Milesians.</p>
<p id="passage-155"><a href="#passage-155" class="passage-id">155</a> The Carians, some while after, repaired their ill fortune in
another action. Understanding that the Persians were about to attack
their cities, they laid an ambush for them on the road which leads
to Pedasus; the Persians, who were making a night-march, fell into the
trap, and the whole army was destroyed, together with the generals,
Daurises, Amorges, and Sisimaces: Myrsus too, the son of Gyges, was
killed at the same time. The leader of the ambush was Heraclides,
the son of Ibanolis, a man of Mylasa. Such was the way in which
these Persians perished.</p>
<p id="passage-156"><a href="#passage-156" class="passage-id">156</a> In the meantime Hymeas, who was likewise one of those by whom
the Ionians were pursued after their attack on Sardis, directing his
course towards the Propontis, took Cius, a city of Mysia. Learning,
however, that Daurises had left the Hellespont, and was gone into
Caria, he in his turn quitted the Propontis, and marching with the
army under his command to the Hellespont, reduced all the Aeolians
of the Troad, and likewise conquered the Gergithae, a remnant of the
ancient Teucrians. He did not, however, quit the Troad, but, after
gaining these successes, was himself carried off by disease.</p>
<p id="passage-157"><a href="#passage-157" class="passage-id">157</a> After his death, which happened as have related, Artaphernes,
the satrap of Sardis, and Otanes, the third general, were directed
to undertake the conduct of the war against Ionia and the neighbouring
Aeolis. By them Clazomenae in the former, and Cyme in the latter, were
recovered.</p>
<p id="passage-158"><a href="#passage-158" class="passage-id">158</a> As the cities fell one after another, Aristagoras the Milesian
(who was in truth, as he now plainly showed, a man of but little
courage), notwithstanding that it was he who had caused the
disturbances in Ionia and made so great a commotion, began, seeing his
danger, to look about for means of escape. Being convinced that it was
in vain to endeavour to overcome King Darius, he called his
brothers-in-arms together, and laid before them the following
project:- "'Twould be well," he said, "to have some place of refuge,
in case they were driven out of Miletus. Should he go out at the
head of a colony to Sardinia, or should he sail to Myrcinus in Edonia,
which Histiaeus had received as a gift from King Darius, and had begun
to fortify?"</p>
<p id="passage-159"><a href="#passage-159" class="passage-id">159</a> To this question of Aristagoras, Hecataeus, the historian, son
of Hegesander, made answer that in his judgement neither place was
suitable. "Aristagoras should build a fort," he said, "in the island
of Leros, and, if driven from Miletus, should go there and bide his
time; from Leros attacks might readily be made, and he might
re-establish himself in Miletus." Such was the advice given by
Hecataeus.</p>
<p id="passage-160"><a href="#passage-160" class="passage-id">160</a> Aristagoras, however, was bent on retiring to Myrcinus.
Accordingly, he put the government of Miletus into the hands of one of
the chief citizens, named Pythagoras, and, taking with him all who
liked to go, sailed to Thrace, and there made himself master of the
place in question. From thence he proceeded to attack the Thracians;
but here he was cut off with his whole army, while besieging a city
whose defenders were anxious to accept terms of surrender.</p>
