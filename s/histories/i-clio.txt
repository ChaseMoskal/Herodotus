Ηρόδοτος ο Αλικαρνασσεύς συνέγραψε και εκοινοποίησε την παρούσαν
ιστορίαν διά να μη εξαλειφθώσιν υπό του χρόνου αι πράξεις των
ανθρώπων και διά να μη περιπέσωσι τα είτε υπό των Ελλήνων είτε υπό
των βαρβάρων εκτελεσθέντα μεγάλα και θαυμαστά κατορθώματα εις
τοιαύτην λήθην ώστε να αγνοήται και αυτή η αιτία δι' ην επολέμησαν
προς αλλήλους οι λαοί ούτοι.

  THESE are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he 
  publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of 
  what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the 
  Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to 
  put on record what were their grounds of feuds.

  [Macaulay]
  This is the Showing forth of the Inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassos,
  to the end that {m1} neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse
  of time, nor the works {m2} great and marvellous, which have been produced
  some by Hellenes and some by Barbarians, may lose their renown; and
  especially that the causes may be remembered for which these waged war
  with one another.

Οι {s1} λόγιοι των Περσών λέγουσιν ότι οι Φοίνικες εγένοντο αίτιοι
της διαφοράς, καθότι αυτοί ελθόντες από τα παράλια της Ερυθράς
λεγομένης θαλάσσης εις τα της Μεσογείου και εγκατασταθέντες εις
τας χώρας τας οποίας κατοικούσιν έτι και σήμερον, επεδόθησαν ευθύς
εις μακράς θαλασσοπλοΐας. Τα πλοία των, πληρούμενα εξ εμπορευμάτων
της Ασσυρίας και της Αιγύπτου, προσωρμίζοντο εις διάφορα μέρη της
Ελλάδος, μεταξύ άλλων δε και εις το Άργος. Κατ' εκείνους δε τους
χρόνους το Άργος κατείχε την πρώτην θέσιν μεταξύ όλων των πόλεων
της χώρας ήτις σήμερον καλείται Ελλάς. Εισελθόντες λοιπόν οι
Φοίνικες εις τον λιμένα του Άργους, επώλουν το φορτίον των. Κατά
την πέμπτην δε ή την έκτην ημέραν, ότε εξεποίησαν σχεδόν όλα όσα
είχον φέρει, είδον ερχομένας εις το παραθαλάσσιον πολλάς γυναίκας,
και μεταξύ αυτών την θυγατέρα του βασιλέως, ήτις εκαλείτο, ως
λέγουσιν επίσης όλοι οι Έλληνες, Ιώ του Ινάχου. Αι γυναίκες·
εστάθησαν πλησίον της πρύμνης του πλοίου εκλέγουσαι και
αγοράζουσαι ό,τι ταις ήρεσκε· τότε οι Φοίνικες, ως εκ συνθήματος,
ώρμησαν επ' αυτών. Και αι μεν πλείσται διέφυγον, αλλ' η Ιώ καί
τινες άλλαι ηρπάγησαν. Αναβιβάσαντες δε αυτάς οι Φοίνικες εις το
πλοίον, απέπλευσαν προς την Αίγυπτον.

  According to the Persians best informed in history, the Phoenicians began 
  to quarrel. This people, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the 
  Erythraean Sea, having migrated to the Mediterranean and settled in the 
  parts which they now inhabit, began at once, they say, to adventure on 
  long voyages, freighting their vessels with the wares of Egypt and Assyria. 
  They landed at many places on the coast, and among the rest at Argos, 
  which was then preeminent above all the states included now under the 
  common name of Hellas. Here they exposed their merchandise, and traded with 
  the natives for five or six days; at the end of which time, when almost 
  everything was sold, there came down to the beach a number of women, and 
  among them the daughter of the king, who was, they say, agreeing in this 
  with the Greeks, Io, the child of Inachus. The women were standing by the 
  stern of the ship intent upon their purchases, when the Phoenicians, with a 
  general shout, rushed upon them. The greater part made their escape, but 
  some were seized and carried off. Io herself was among the captives. The 
  Phoenicians put the women on board their vessel, and set sail for Egypt. 
  Thus did Io pass into Egypt, according to the Persian story, which differs 
  widely from the Phoenician: and thus commenced, according to their authors, 
  the series of outrages.

  [Macaulay]
  Those of the Persians who have knowledge of history declare that
  the Phenicians first began the quarrel. These, they say, came from that
  which is called the Erythraian Sea to this of ours; and having settled
  in the land where they continue even now to dwell, set themselves
  forthwith to make long voyages by sea. And conveying merchandise of
  Egypt and of Assyria they arrived at other places and also at Argos; now
  Argos was at that time in all points the first of the States within that
  land which is now called Hellas; the Phenicians arrived then at this
  land of Argos, and began to dispose of their ship's cargo: and on the
  fifth or sixth day after they had arrived, when their goods had been
  almost all sold, there came down to the sea a great company of women,
  and among them the daughter of the king; and her name, as the Hellenes
  also agree, was Io the daughter of Inachos. These standing near to the
  stern of the ship were buying of the wares such as pleased them most,
  when of a sudden the Phenicians, passing the word from one to another,
  made a rush upon them; and the greater part of the women escaped by
  flight, but Io and certain others were carried off. So they put them on
  board their ship, and forthwith departed, sailing away to Egypt.

[Skalides]
Ούτω, ως λέγουσιν οι Πέρσαι, και ουχί ως λέγουσιν οι Έλληνες, η
Ιώ ήλθεν εις την Αίγυπτον, και τούτο υπήρξεν η πρώτη αιτία των
ακολούθων αδικημάτων. Μετά τούτο, Έλληνες τινές, των οποίων
αγνοείται και αυτό το όνομα, προσεγγίσαντες εις την Τύρον της
Φοινίκης, ήρπασαν την θυγατέρα του βασιλέως Ευρώπην. Υποτίθεται
ότι ήσαν Κρήτες. Τοιουτοτρόπως λοιπόν η προσβολή επληρώθη διά
προσβολής. Αλλ' έπειτα οι Έλληνες εγένοντο αίτιοι και δευτέρας
αδικίας. Αφού έπλευσαν διά μακρού πλοίου εις την Αίαν της Κολχίδος
και τον Φάσιν ποταμόν, και αφού εξετέλεσαν την υπόθεσιν διά την
οποίαν ήλθον, ήρπασαν την θυγατέρα του βασιλέως Μήδειαν. Ο
βασιλεύς ούτος έπεμψε κήρυκα εις την Ελλάδα ζητών ικανοποίησιν διά
την αρπαγήν και απαιτών να τω επιστραφή η θυγάτηρ του. Αλλ' οι
Έλληνες απεκρίθησαν ότι επειδή εκείνοι ουδεμίαν ικανοποίησιν
έδωκαν εις αυτούς διά την αρπαγήν της Αργείας Ιούς, κατά συνέπειαν
ούτε αυτοί θα δώσωσιν εις εκείνους.

  [Rawlinson]
  At a later period, certain Greeks, with whose name they are unacquainted, 
  but who would probably be Cretans, made a landing at Tyre, on the 
  Phoenician coast, and bore off the king's daughter, Europe. In this they 
  only retaliated; but afterwards the Greeks, they say, were guilty of a 
  second violence. They manned a ship of war, and sailed to Aea, a city of 
  Colchis, on the river Phasis; from whence, after despatching the rest of 
  the business on which they had come, they carried off Medea, the daughter 
  of the king of the land. The monarch sent a herald into Greece to demand 
  reparation of the wrong, and the restitution of his child; but the Greeks 
  made answer that, having received no reparation of the wrong done them in 
  the seizure of Io the Argive, they should give none in this instance.

  [Macaulay]
  In this manner the Persians report that Io came to Egypt, not
  agreeing therein with the Hellenes, {3} and this they say was the first
  beginning of wrongs. Then after this, they say, certain Hellenes (but
  the name of the people they are not able to report) put in to the city
  of Tyre in Phenicia and carried off the king's daughter Europa; these
  would doubtless be Cretans;and so they were quits for the former
  injury. After this however the Hellenes, they say, were the authors of
  the second wrong; for they sailed in to Aia of Colchis and to the river
  Phasis with a ship of war, and from thence, after they had done the
  other business for which they came, they carried off the king's daughter
  Medea: and the king of Colchis sent a herald to the land of Hellas and
  demanded satisfaction for the rape and to have his daughter back; but
  they answered that, as the Barbarians had given them no satisfaction for
  the rape of Io the Argive, so neither would they give satisfaction to
  the Barbarians for this.

[Skalides]
Μετά δύο γενεάς ο υιός του Πριάμου Αλέξανδρος, ακούσας τα
συμβάντα ταύτα, απεφάσισε να αρπάση γυναίκα εκ της Ελλάδος,
πεπεισμένος ότι ουδεμίαν ήθελε δώσει ικανοποίησιν, αφού και οι
Έλληνες δεν έδωκαν. Αλλ' όταν ήρπασε την Ελένην, οι Έλληνες
ενέκριναν να πέμψωσι πρώτον πρέσβεις διά να απαιτήσωσι την
απόδοσιν της Ελένης και να ζητήσωσιν ικανοποίησιν. Οι δε Τρώες,
ακούσαντες τους πρέσβεις, απεκρίθησαν ότι οι Έλληνες, μη δόντες
ικανοποίησιν διά την αρπαγήν της Μηδείας μήτε αποδώσαντες αυτήν
ζητουμένην, δεν έπρεπε να απαιτώσιν ικανοποίησιν παρ' άλλων.

  [Rawlinson]
  In the next generation afterwards, according to the same authorities, 
  Alexander the son of Priam, bearing these events in mind, resolved to 
  procure himself a wife out of Greece by violence, fully persuaded, that as 
  the Greeks had not given satisfaction for their outrages, so neither would 
  he be forced to make any for his. Accordingly he made prize of Helen; upon 
  which the Greeks decided that, before resorting to other measures, they 
  would send envoys to reclaim the princess and require reparation of the 
  wrong. Their demands were met by a reference to the violence which had been 
  offered to Medea, and they were asked with what face they could now require 
  satisfaction, when they had formerly rejected all demands for either 
  reparation or restitution addressed to them.

  [Macaulay]
  In the next generation after this, they say, Alexander the son of
  Priam, having heard of these things, desired to get a wife for himself
  by violence {4} from Hellas, being fully assured that he would not be
  compelled to give any satisfaction for this wrong, inasmuch as the
  Hellenes gave none for theirs. So he carried off Helen, and the
  Hellenes resolved to send messengers first and to demand her back with
  satisfaction for the rape; and when they put forth this demand, the
  others alleged to them the rape of Medea, saying that the Hellenes were
  now desiring satisfaction to be given to them by others, though they
  had given none themselves nor had surrendered the person when demand was
  made.

{m1} {'Erodotou 'Alikarnesseos istories apodexis ede, os k.t.l.} The 
meaning of the word {istorie} passes gradually from "research" or
"inquiry" to "narrative," "history"; cp. vii. 96. Aristotle in quoting  
these words writes {Thouriou} for {'Alikarnesseos} ("Herodotus of  
Thurii"), and we know from Plutarch that this reading existed in his  
time as a variation.

{m2} Probably {erga} may here mean enduring monuments like the pyramids  
and the works at Samos, cp. i. 93, ii. 35, etc.; in that case {ta te  
alla} refers back to {ta genomena}, though the verb {epolemesan} derives  
its subject from the mention of Hellenes and Barbarians in the preceding  
clause.

{m3} Many Editors have "with the Phenicians," on the authority of some
inferior MSS. and of the Aldine edition.
