THE Greeks engaged in the sea-service were the following. The
Athenians furnished a hundred and twenty-seven vessels to the fleet,
which were manned in part by the Plataeans, who, though unskilled in
such matters, were led by their active and daring spirit to
undertake this duty; the Corinthians furnished a contingent of forty
vessels; the Megarians sent twenty; the Chalcideans also manned
twenty, which had been furnished to them by the Athenians; the
Eginetans came with eighteen; the Sicyonians with twelve; the
Lacedaemonians with ten; the Epidaurians with eight; the Eretrians
with seven; the Troezenians with five; the Styreans with two; and
the Ceans with two triremes and two penteconters. Last of all, the
Locrians of Opus came in aid with a squadron of seven penteconters.

Such were the nations which furnished vessels to the fleet now
at Artemisium; and in mentioning them I have given the number of ships
furnished by each. The total number of the ships thus brought
together, without counting the penteconters, was two hundred and
seventy-one; and the captain, who had the chief command over the whole
fleet, was Eurybiades the son of Eurycleides. He was furnished by
Sparta, since the allies had said that "if a Lacedaemonian did not
take the command, they would break up the fleet, for never would
they serve under the Athenians."

From the first, even earlier than the time when the embassy went
to Sicily to solicit alliance, there had been a talk of intrusting the
Athenians with the command at sea; but the allies were averse to the
plan, wherefore the Athenians did not press it; for there was
nothing they had so much at heart as the salvation of Greece, and they
knew that, if they quarrelled among themselves about the command,
Greece would be brought to ruin. Herein they judged rightly; for
internal strife is a thing as much worse than war carried on by a
united people, as war itself is worse than peace. The Athenians
therefore, being so persuaded, did not push their claims, but waived
them, so long as they were in such great need of aid from the other
Greeks. And they afterwards showed their motive; for at the time
when the Persians had been driven from Greece, and were now threatened
by the Greeks in their own country, they took occasion of the
insolence of Pausanias to deprive the Lacedaemonians of their
leadership. This, however, happened afterwards.

At the present time the Greeks, on their arrival at Artemisium,
when they saw the number of the ships which lay at anchor near
Aphetae, and the abundance of troops everywhere, feeling
disappointed that matters had gone with the barbarians so far
otherwise than they had expected, and full of alarm at what they
saw, began to speak of drawing back from Artemisium towards the
inner parts of their country. So when the Euboeans heard what was in
debate, they went to Eurybiades, and besought him to wait a few
days, while they removed their children and their slaves to a place of
safety. But, as they found that they prevailed nothing, they left
him and went to Themistocles, the Athenian commander, to whom they
gave a bribe of thirty talents, on his promise that the fleet should
remain and risk a battle in defence of Euboea.

And Themistocles succeeded in detaining the fleet in the way which
I will now relate. He made over to Eurybiades five talents out of
the thirty paid him, which he gave as if they came from himself; and
having in this way gained over the admiral, he addressed himself to
Adeimantus, the son of Ocytus, the Corinthian leader, who was the only
remonstrant now, and who still threatened to sail away from Artemisium
and not wait for the other captains. Addressing himself to this man,
Themistocles said with an oath- "Thou forsake us? By no means! I
will pay thee better for remaining than the Mede would for leaving thy
friends"- and straightway he sent on board the ship of Adeimantus a
present of three talents of silver. So these two captains were won
by gifts, and came over to the views of Themistocles, who was
thereby enabled to gratify the wishes of the Euboeans. He likewise
made his own gain on the occasion; for he kept the rest of the
money, and no one knew of it. The commanders who took the gifts
thought that the sums were furnished by Athens, and had been sent to
be used in this way.

Thus it came to pass that the Greeks stayed at Euboea and there
gave battle to the enemy.

Now the battle was on this wise. The barbarians reached Aphetae
early in the afternoon, and then saw (as they had previously heard
reported) that a fleet of Greek ships, weak in number, lay at
Artemisium. At once they were eager to engage, fearing that the Greeks
would fly, and hoping to capture them before they should get away.
They did not however think it wise to make straight for the Greek
station, lest the enemy should see them as they bore down, and
betake themselves to flight immediately; in which case night might
close in before they came up with the fugitives, and so they might get
clean off and make their escape from them; whereas the Persians were
minded not to let a single soul slip through their hands.

They therefore contrived a plan, which was the following:- They
detached two hundred of their ships from the rest, and- to prevent the
enemy from seeing them start- sent them round outside the island of
Sciathos, to make the circuit of Euboea by Caphareus and Geraestus,
and so to reach the Euripus. By this plan they thought to enclose
the Greeks on every side; for the ships detached would block up the
only way by which they could retreat, while the others would press
upon them in front. With these designs therefore they dispatched the
two hundred ships, while they themselves waited- since they did not
mean to attack the Greeks upon that day, or until they knew, by
signal, of the arrival of the detachment which had been ordered to
sail round Euboea. Meanwhile they made a muster of the other ships
at Aphetae.

Now the Persians had with them a man named Scyllias, a native of
Scione, who was the most expert diver of his day. At the time of the
shipwreck off Mount Pelion he had recovered for the Persians a great
part of what they lost; and at the same time he had taken care to
obtain for himself a good share of the treasure. He had for some
time been wishing to go over to the Greeks; but no good opportunity
had offered till now, when the Persians were making the muster of
their ships. In what way he contrived to reach the Greeks I am not
able to say for certain: I marvel much if the tale that is commonly
told be true. 'Tis said he dived into the sea at Aphetae, and did
not once come to the surface till he reached Artemisium, a distance of
nearly eighty furlongs. Now many things are related of this man
which are plainly false; but some of the stories seem to be true. My
own opinion is that on this occasion he made the passage to Artemisium
in a boat.

However this might be, Scyllias no sooner reached Artemisium
than he gave the Greek captains a full account of the damage done by
the storm, and likewise told them of the ships sent to make the
circuit of Euboea.

So the Greeks on receiving these tidings held a council,
whereat, after much debate, it was resolved that they should stay
quiet for the present where they were, and remain at their moorings,
but that after midnight they should put out to sea, and encounter
the ships which were on their way round the island. Later in the
day, when they found that no one meddled with them, they formed a
new plan, which was to wait till near evening, and then sail out
against the main body of the barbarians, for the purpose of trying
their mode of fight and skill in manoeuvring.

When the Persian commanders and crews saw the Greeks thus boldly
sailing towards them with their few ships, they thought them possessed
with madness, and went out to meet them, expecting (as indeed seemed
likely enough) that they would take all their vessels with the
greatest ease. The Greek ships were so few, and their own so far
outnumbered them, and sailed so much better, that they resolved,
seeing their advantage, to encompass their foe on every side. And
now such of the Ionians as wished well to the Grecian cause and served
in the Persian fleet unwillingly, seeing their countrymen
surrounded, were sorely distressed; for they felt sure that not one of
them would ever make his escape, so poor an opinion had they of the
strength of the Greeks. On the other hand, such as saw with pleasure
the attack on Greece, now vied eagerly with each other which should be
the first to make prize of an Athenian ship, and thereby to secure
himself a rich reward from the king. For through both the hosts none
were so much accounted of as the Athenians.

The Greeks, at a signal, brought the sterns of their ships
together into a small compass, and turned their prows on every side
towards the barbarians; after which, at a second signal, although
inclosed within a narrow space, and closely pressed upon by the foe,
yet they fell bravely to work, and captured thirty ships of the
barbarians, at the same time taking prisoner Philaon, the son of
Chersis, and brother of Gorgus king of Salamis, a man of much repute
in the fleet. The first who made prize of a ship of the enemy was
Lycomedes the son of Aeschreas, an Athenian, who was afterwards
adjudged the meed of valour. Victory however was still doubtful when
night came on, and put a stop to the combat. The Greeks sailed back to
Artemisium; and the barbarians returned to Aphetae, much surprised
at the result, which was far other than they had looked for. In this
battle only one of the Greeks who fought on the side of the king
deserted and joined his countrymen. This was Antidorus of Lemnos, whom
the Athenians rewarded for his desertion by the present of a piece
of land in Salamis.

Evening had barely closed in when a heavy rain- it was about
midsummer- began to fall, which continued the whole night, with
terrible thunderings and lightnings from Mount Pelion: the bodies of
the slain and the broken pieces of the damaged ships were drifted in
the direction of Aphetae, and floated about the prows of the vessels
there, disturbing the action of the oars. The barbarians, hearing
the storm, were greatly dismayed, expecting certainly to perish, as
they had fallen into such a multitude of misfortunes. For before
they were well recovered from the tempest and the wreck of their
vessels off Mount Pelion, they had been surprised by a sea-fight which
had taxed all their strength, and now the sea-fight was scarcely
over when they were exposed to floods of rain, and the rush of swollen
streams into the sea, and violent thunderings.

If, however, they who lay at Aphetae passed a comfortless night,
far worse were the sufferings of those who had been sent to make the
circuit of Euboea; inasmuch as the storm fell on them out at sea,
whereby the issue was indeed calamitous. They were sailing along
near the Hollows of Euboea, when the wind began to rise and the rain
to pour: overpowered by the force of the gale, and driven they knew
not whither, at the last they fell upon rocks- Heaven so contriving,
in order that the Persian fleet might not greatly exceed the Greek,
but be brought nearly to its level. This squadron, therefore, was
entirely lost about the Hollows of Euboea.

The barbarians at Aphetae were glad when day dawned, and
remained in quiet at their station, content if they might enjoy a
little peace after so many sufferings. Meanwhile there came to the aid
of the Greeks a reinforcement of fifty-three ships from Attica.
Their arrival, and the news (which reached Artemisium about the same
time) of the complete destruction by the storm of the ships sent to
sail round Euboea, greatly cheered the spirits of the Greek sailors.
So they waited again till the same hour as the day before, and, once
more putting out to sea, attacked the enemy. This time they fell in
with some Cilician vessels, which they sank; when night came on,
they withdrew to Artemisium.

The third day was now come, and the captains of the barbarians,
ashamed that so small a number of ships should harass their fleet, and
afraid of the anger of Xerxes, instead of waiting for the others to
begin the battle, weighed anchor themselves, and advanced against
the Greeks about the hour of noon, with shouts encouraging one
another. Now it happened that these sea-fights took place on the
very same days with the combats at Thermopylae; and as the aim of
the struggle was in the one case to maintain the pass, so in the other
it was to defend the Euripus. While the Greeks, therefore, exhorted
one another not to let the barbarians burst in upon Greece, these
latter shouted to their fellows to destroy the Grecian fleet, and
get possession of the channel.

And now the fleet of Xerxes advanced in good order to the
attack, while the Greeks on their side remained quite motionless at
Artemisium. The Persians therefore spread themselves, and came forward
in a half-moon, seeking to encircle the Greeks on all sides, and
thereby prevent them from escaping. The Greeks, when they saw this,
sailed out to meet their assailants; and the battle forthwith began.
In this engagement the two fleets contended with no clear advantage to
either- for the armament of Xerxes injured itself by its own
greatness, the vessels falling into disorder, and oft-times running
foul of one another; yet still they did not give way, but made a stout
fight, since the crews felt it would indeed be a disgrace to turn
and fly from a fleet so inferior in number. The Greeks therefore
suffered much, both in ships and men; but the barbarians experienced a
far larger loss of each. So the fleets separated after such a combat
as I have described.

On the side of Xerxes the Egyptians distinguished themselves above
all the combatants; for besides performing many other noble deeds,
they took five vessels from the Greeks with their crews on board. On
the side of the Greeks the Athenians bore off the meed of valour;
and among them the most distinguished was Clinias, the son of
Alcibiades, who served at his own charge with two hundred men, on
board a vessel which he had himself furnished.

The two fleets, on separating, hastened very gladly to their
anchorage-grounds. The Greeks, indeed, when the battle was over,
became masters of the bodies of the slain and the wrecks of the
vessels; but they had been so roughly handled, especially the
Athenians, one-half of whose vessels had suffered damage, that they
determined to break up from their station, and withdraw to the inner
parts of their country.

Then Themistocles, who thought that if the Ionian and Carian ships
could be detached from the barbarian fleet, the Greeks might be well
able to defeat the rest, called the captains together. They met upon
the seashore, where the Euboeans were now assembling their flocks
and herds; and here Themistocles told them he thought that he knew
of a plan whereby he could detach from the king those who were of most
worth among his allies. This was all that he disclosed to them of
his plan at that time. Meanwhile, looking to the circumstances in
which they were, he advised them to slaughter as many of the Euboean
cattle- they liked- for it was better (he said) that their own
troops should enjoy them than the enemy- and to give orders to their
men to kindle the fires as usual. With regard to the retreat, he
said that he would take upon himself to watch the proper moment, and
would manage matters so that they should return to Greece without
loss. These words pleased the captains; so they had the fires lighted,
and began the slaughter of the cattle.

The Euboeans, until now, had made light of the oracle of Bacis, as
though it had been void of all significancy, and had neither removed
their goods from the island, nor yet taken them into their strong
places; as they would most certainly have done if they had believed
that war was approaching. By this neglect they had brought their
affairs into the very greatest danger. Now the oracle of which I speak
ran as follows:-


When o'er the main shall be thrown a byblus yoke by a stranger,

Be thou ware, and drive from Euboea the goats' loud-bleating.

So, as the Euboeans had paid no regard to this oracle when the evils
approached and impended, now that they had arrived, the worst was
likely to befall them.

While the Greeks were employed in the way described above, the
scout who had been on the watch at Trachis arrived at Artemisium.
For the Greeks had employed two watchers:- Polyas, a native of
Anticyra, had been stationed off Artemisium, with a row-boat at his
command ready to sail at any moment, his orders being that, if an
engagement took place by sea, he should convey the news at once to the
Greeks at Thermopylae; and in like manner Abronychus the son of
Lysicles, an Athenian, had been stationed with a triaconter near
Leonidas, to be ready, in case of disaster befalling the land force,
to carry tidings of it to Artemisium. It was this Abronychus who now
arrived with news of what had befallen Leonidas and those who were
with him. When the Greeks heard the tidings they no longer delayed
to retreat, but withdrew in the order wherein they had been stationed,
the Corinthians leading, and the Athenians sailing last of all.

And now Themistocles chose out the swiftest sailers from among the
Athenian vessels, and, proceeding to the various watering-places along
the coast, cut inscriptions on the rocks, which were read by the
Ionians the day following, on their arrival at Artemisium. The
inscriptions ran thus:- "Men of Ionia, ye do wrong to fight against
your own fathers, and to give your help to enslave Greece. We
beseech you therefore to come over, if possible, to our side: if you
cannot do this, then, we pray you, stand aloof from the contest
yourselves, and persuade the Carians to do the like. If neither of
these things be possible, and you are hindered, by a force too
strong to resist, from venturing upon desertion, at least when we come
to blows fight backwardly, remembering that you are sprung from us,
and that it was through you we first provoked the hatred of the
barbarian." Themistocles, in putting up these inscriptions, looked,
I believe, to two chances- either Xerxes would not discover them, in
which case they might bring over the Ionians to the side of the
Greeks; or they would be reported to him and made a ground of
accusation against the Ionians, who would thereupon be distrusted, and
would not be allowed to take part in the sea-fights.

Shortly after the cutting of the inscriptions, a man of Histiaea
went in a merchantship to Aphetae, and told the Persians that the
Greeks had fled from Artemisium. Disbelieving his report, the Persians
kept the man a prisoner, while they sent some of their fastest vessels
to see what had happened. These brought back word how matters stood;
whereupon at sunrise the whole fleet advanced together in a body,
and sailed to Artemisium, where they remained till mid-day; after
which they went on to Histiaea. That city fell into their hands
immediately; and they shortly overran the various villages upon the
coast in the district of Hellopia, which was part of the Histiaean
territory.

It was while they were at this station that a herald reached
them from Xerxes, whom he had sent after making the following
dispositions with respect to the bodies of those who fell at
Thermopylae. Of the twenty thousand who had been slain on the
Persian side, he left one thousand upon the field while he buried
the rest in trenches; and these he carefully filled up with earth, and
hid with foliage, that the sailors might not see any signs of them.
The herald, on reaching Histiaea, caused the whole force to be
collected together, and spake thus to them:

"Comrades, King Xerxes gives permission to all who please, to quit
their posts, and see how he fights with the senseless men who think to
overthrow his armies."

No sooner had these words been uttered, than it became difficult
to get a boat, so great was the number of those who desired to see the
sight. Such as went crossed the strait, and passing among the heaps of
dead, in this way viewed the spectacle. Many helots were included in
the slain, but every one imagined that the bodies were all either
Lacedaemonians or Thespians. However, no one was deceived by what
Xerxes had done with his own dead. It was indeed most truly a
laughable device- on the one side a thousand men were seen lying about
the field, on the other four thousand crowded together into one
spot. This day then was given up to sight-seeing; on the next the
seamen embarked on board their ships and sailed back to Histiaea,
while Xerxes and his army proceeded upon their march.

There came now a few deserters from Arcadia to join the
Persians- poor men who had nothing to live on, and were in want of
employment. The Persians brought them into the king's presence, and
there inquired of them, by a man who acted as their spokesman, "what
the Greeks were doing?" The Arcadians answered- "They are holding
the Olympic Games, seeing the athletic sports and the
chariot-races." "And what," said the man, "is the prize for which they
contend?" "An olive-wreath," returned the others, "which is given to
the man who wins." On hearing this, Tritantaechmes, the son of
Artabanus, uttered a speech which was in truth most noble, but which
caused him to be taxed with cowardice by King Xerxes. Hearing the
men say that the prize was not money but a wreath of olive, he could
not forbear from exclaiming before them all: "Good heavens! Mardonius,
what manner of men are these against whom thou hast brought us to
fight?- men who contend with one another, not for money, but for
honour!"

A little before this, and just after the blow had been struck at
Thermopylae, a herald was sent into Phocis by the Thessalians, who had
always been on bad terms with the Phocians, and especially since their
last overthrow. For it was not many years previous to this invasion of
Greece by the king, that the Thessalians, with their allies, entered
Phocis in full force, but were defeated by the Phocians in an
engagement wherein they were very roughly handled. The Phocians, who
had with them as soothsayer Tellias of Elis, were blocked up in the
mountain of Parnassus, when the following stratagem was contrived
for them by their Elean ally. He took six hundred of their bravest
men, and whitened their bodies and their arms with chalk; then
instructing them to slay every one whom they should meet that was
not whitened like themselves, he made a night attack upon the
Thessalians. No sooner did the Thessalian sentries, who were the first
to see them, behold this strange sight, than, imagining it to be a
prodigy, they were all filled with affright. From the sentries the
alarm spread to the army, which was seized with such a panic that
the Phocians killed four thousand of them, and became masters of their
dead bodies and shields. Of the shields one half were sent as an
offering to the temple at Abae, the other half were deposited at
Delphi; while from the tenth part of the booty gained in the battle,
were made the gigantic figures which stand round the tripod in front
of the Delphic shrine, and likewise the figures of the same size and
character at Abae.

Besides this slaughter of the Thessalian foot when it was
blockading them, the Phocians had dealt a blow to their horse upon its
invading their territory, from which they had never recovered. There
is a pass near the city of Hyampolis, where the Phocians, having dug a
broad trench, filled up the void with empty wine-jars, after which
they covered the place with mould, so that the ground all looked
alike, and then awaited the coming of the Thessalians. These, thinking
to destroy the Phocians at one sweep, rushed rapidly forward, and
became entangled in the wine-jars, which broke the legs of their
horses.

The Thessalians had therefore a double cause of quarrel with the
Phocians, when they dispatched the herald above mentioned, who thus
delivered his message:-

"At length acknowledge, ye men of Phocis, that ye may not think to
match with us. In times past, when it pleased us to hold with the
Greeks, we had always the vantage over you; and now our influence is
such with the barbarian, that, if we choose it, you will lose your
country, and (what is even worse) you will be sold as slaves. However,
though we can now do with you exactly as we like, we are willing to
forget our wrongs. Quit them with a payment of fifty talents of
silver, and we undertake to ward off the evils which threaten your
country."

Such was the message which the Thessalians sent. The Phocians were
the only people in these parts who had not espoused the cause of the
Medes; and it is my deliberate opinion that the motive which swayed
them was none other- neither more nor less- than their hatred of the
Thessalians: for had the Thessalians declared in favour of the Greeks,
I believe that the men of Phocis would have joined the Median side. As
it was, when the message arrived, the Phocians made answer, that "they
would not pay anything- it was open to them, equally with the
Thessalians, to make common cause with the Medes, if they only chose
so to do- but they would never of their own free will become
traitors to Greece."

On the return of this answer, the Thessalians, full of wrath
against the Phocians, offered themselves as guides to the barbarian
army, and led them forth from Trachinia into Doris. In this place
there is a narrow tongue of Dorian territory, not more than thirty
furlongs across, interposed between Malis and Phocis; it is the
tract in ancient times called Dryopis; and the land, of which it is
a part, is the mother-country of the Dorians in the Peloponnese.
This territory the barbarians did not plunder, for the inhabitants had
espoused their side; and besides, the Thessalians wished that they
should be spared.

From Doris they marched forward into Phocis; but here the
inhabitants did not fall into their power: for some of them had
taken refuge in the high grounds of Parnassus- one summit of which,
called Tithorea, standing quite by itself, not far from the city of
Neon, is well fitted to give shelter to a large body of men, and had
now received a number of the Phocians with their movables; while the
greater portion had fled to the country of the Ozolian Locrians, and
placed their goods in the city called Amphissa, which lies above the
Crissaean plain. The land of Phocis, however, was entirely overrun,
for the Thessalians led the Persian army through the whole of it;
and wherever they went, the country was wasted with fire and sword,
the cities and even the temples being wilfully set alight by the
troops.

The march of the army lay along the valley of the Cephissus; and
here they ravaged far and wide, burning the towns of Drymus, Charadra,
Erochus, Tethronium, Amphicaea, Neon, Pedieis, Triteis, Elateia,
Hyampolis, Parapotamii, and Abae. At the last-named place there was
a temple of Apollo, very rich, and adorned with a vast number of
treasures and offerings. There was likewise an oracle there in those
days, as indeed there is at the present time. This temple the Persians
plundered and burnt; and here they captured a number of the Phocians
before they could reach the hills, and caused the death of some of
their women by ill-usage.

After passing Parapotamii, the barbarians marched to Panopeis; and
now the army separated into two bodies, whereof one, which was the
more numerous and the stronger of the two, marched, under Xerxes
himself, towards Athens, entering Boeotia by the country of the
Orchomenians. The Boeotians had one and all embraced the cause of
the Medes; and their towns were in the possession of Macedonian
garrisons, whom Alexander had sent there, to make it manifest to
Xerxes that the Boeotians were on the Median side. Such then was the
road followed by one division of the barbarians.

The other division took guides, and proceeded towards the temple
of Delphi, keeping Mount Parnassus on their right hand. They too
laid waste such parts of Phocis as they passed through, burning the
city of the Panopeans, together with those of the Daulians and of
the Aeolidae. This body had been detached from the rest of the army,
and made to march in this direction, for the purpose of plundering the
Delphian temple and conveying to King Xerxes the riches which were
there laid up. For Xerxes, as I am informed, was better acquainted
with what there was worthy of note at Delphi, than even with what he
had left in his own house; so many of those about him were continually
describing the treasures- more especially the offerings made by
Croesus the son of Alyattes.

Now when the Delphians heard what danger they were in, great
fear fell on them. In their terror they consulted the oracle
concerning the holy treasures, and inquired if they should bury them
in the ground, or carry them away to some other country. The god, in
reply, bade them leave the treasures untouched- "He was able," he
said, "without help to protect his own." So the Delphians, when they
received this answer, began to think about saving themselves. And
first of all they sent their women and children across the gulf into
Achaea; after which the greater number of them climbed up into the
tops of Parnassus, and placed their goods for safety in the Corycian
cave; while some effected their escape to Amphissa in Locris. In
this way all the Delphians quitted the city, except sixty men, and the
Prophet.

When the barbarian assailants drew near and were in sight of the
place, the Prophet, who was named Aceratus, beheld, in front of the
temple, a portion of the sacred armour, which it was not lawful for
any mortal hand to touch, lying upon the ground, removed from the
inner shrine where it was wont to hang. Then went he and told the
prodigy to the Delphians who had remained behind. Meanwhile the
enemy pressed forward briskly, and had reached the shrine of Minerva
Pronaia, when they were overtaken by other prodigies still more
wonderful than the first. Truly it was marvel enough, when warlike
harness was seen lying outside the temple, removed there by no power
but its own; what followed, however, exceeded in strangeness all
prodigies that had ever before been seen. The barbarians had just
reached in their advance the chapel of Minerva Pronaia, when a storm
of thunder burst suddenly over their heads- at the same time two crags
split off from Mount Parnassus, and rolled down upon them with a
loud noise, crushing vast numbers beneath their weight- while from the
temple of Minerva there went up the war-cry and the shout of victory.

All these things together struck terror into the barbarians, who
forthwith turned and fled. The Delphians, seeing this, came down
from their hiding-places, and smote them with a great slaughter,
from which such as escaped fled straight into Boeotia. These men, on
their return, declared (as I am told) that besides the marvels
mentioned above, they witnessed also other supernatural sights. Two
armed warriors, they said, of a stature more than human, pursued after
their flying ranks, pressing them close and slaying them.

These men, the Delphians maintain, were two Heroes belonging to
the place- by name Phylacus and Autonous- each of whom has a sacred
precinct near the temple; one, that of Phylacus, hard by the road
which runs above the temple of Pronaia; the other, that of Autonous,
near the Castalian spring, at the foot of the peak called Hyampeia.
The blocks of stone which fell from Parnassus might still be seen in
my day; they lay in the precinct of Pronaia, where they stopped, after
rolling through the host of the barbarians. Thus was this body of
men forced to retire from the temple.

Meanwhile, the Grecian fleet, which had left Artemisium, proceeded
to Salamis, at the request of the Athenians, and there cast anchor.
The Athenians had begged them to take up this position, in order
that they might convey their women and children out of Attica, and
further might deliberate upon the course which it now behoved them
to follow. Disappointed in the hopes which they had previously
entertained, they were about to hold a council concerning the
present posture of their affairs. For they had looked to see the
Peloponnesians drawn up in full force to resist the enemy in
Boeotia, but found nothing of what they had expected; nay, they learnt
that the Greeks of those parts, only concerning themselves about their
own safety, were building a wall across the Isthmus, and intended to
guard the Peloponnese, and let the rest of Greece take its chance.
These tidings caused them to make the request whereof I spoke, that
the combined fleet should anchor at Salamis.

So while the rest of the fleet lay to off this island, the
Athenians cast anchor along their own coast. Immediately upon their
arrival, proclamation was made that every Athenian should save his
children and household as he best could; whereupon some sent their
families to Egina, some to Salamis, but the greater number to Troezen.
This removal was made with all possible haste, partly from a desire to
obey the advice of the oracle, but still more for another reason.
The Athenians say that they have in their Acropolis a huge serpent,
which lives in the temple, and is the guardian of the whole place. Nor
do they only say this, but, as if the serpent really dwelt there,
every month they lay out its food, which consists of a honey-cake.
Up to this time the honey-cake had always been consumed; but now it
remained untouched. So the priestess told the people what had
happened; whereupon they left Athens the more readily, since they
believed that the goddess had already abandoned the citadel. As soon
as all was removed, the Athenians sailed back to their station.

And now, the remainder of the Grecian sea-force, hearing that
the fleet which had been at Artemisium, was come to Salamis, joined it
at that island from Troezen- orders having been issued previously that
the ships should muster at Pogon, the port of the Troezenians. The
vessels collected were many more in number than those which had fought
at Artemisium, and were furnished by more cities. The admiral was
the same who had commanded before, to wit, Eurybiades, the son of
Eurycleides, who was a Spartan, but not of the family of the kings:
the city, however, which sent by far the greatest number of ships, and
the best sailers, was Athens.

Now these were the nations who composed the Grecian fleet. From
the Peloponnese, the following- the Lacedaemonians with six, teen
ships; the Corinthians with the same number as at Artemisium; the
Sicyonians with fifteen; the Epidaurians with ten; the Troezenians
with five; and the Hermionians with three. These were Dorians and
Macedonians all of them (except those from Hermione), and had
emigrated last from Erineus, Pindus, and Dryopis. The Hermionians were
Dryopians, of the race which Hercules and the Malians drove out of the
land now called Doris. Such were the Peloponnesian nations.

From the mainland of Greece beyond the Peloponnese, came the
Athenians with a hundred and eighty ships, a greater number than
that furnished by any other people; and these were now manned wholly
by themselves; for the Plataeans did not serve aboard the Athenian
ships at Salamis, owing to the following reason. When the Greeks, on
their withdrawal from Artemisium, arrived off Chalcis, the Plataeans
disembarked upon the opposite shore of Boeotia, and set to work to
remove their households, whereby it happened that they were left
behind. (The Athenians, when the region which is now called Greece was
held by the Pelasgi, were Pelasgians, and bore the name of Cranaans;
but under their king Cecrops, they were called Cecropidae; when
Erechtheus got the sovereignty, they changed their name to
Athenians; and when Ion, the son of Xuthus, became their general, they
were named after him Ionians.)

The Megarians served with the same number of ships as at
Artemisium; the Ambraciots came with seven; the Leucadians (who were
Dorians from Corinth) with three.

Of the islanders, the Eginetans furnished thirty ships- they had a
larger number equipped; but some were kept back to guard their own
coasts, and only thirty, which however were their best sailers, took
part in the fight at Salamis. (The Eginetans are Dorians from
Epidaurus; their island was called formerly Oenone). The Chalcideans
came next in order; they furnished the twenty ships with which they
had served at Artemisium. The Eretrians likewise furnished their
seven. These races are Ionian. Ceos gave its old number- the Ceans are
Ionians from Attica. Naxos furnished four: this detachment, like those
from the other islands, had been sent by the citizens at home to
join the Medes; but they made light of the orders given them, and
joined the Greeks, at the instigation of Democritus, a citizen of good
report, who was at that time captain of a trireme. The Naxians are
Ionians, of the Athenian stock. The Styreans served with the same
ships as before; the Cythnians contributed one, and likewise a
penteconter- these two nations are Dryopians: the Seriphians,
Siphnians, and Melians, also served; they were the only islanders
who had not given earth and water to the barbarian.

All these nations dwelt inside the river Acheron and the country
inhabited by the Thesprotians; for that people borders on the
Ambraciots and Leucadians, who are the most remote of all those by
whom the fleet was furnished. From the countries beyond, there was
only one people which gave help to the Greeks in their danger. This
was the people of Crotona, who contributed a single ship, under the
command of Phayllus, a man who had thrice carried off the prize at the
Pythian Games. The Crotoniats are, by descent, Achaeans.

Most of the allies came with triremes; but the Melians, Siphnians,
and Seriphians, brought penteconters. The Melians, who draw their race
from Lacedaemon, furnished two; the Siphnians and Seriphians, who
are Ionians of the Athenian stock, one each. The whole number of the
ships, without counting the penteconters, was three hundred and
seventy-eight.

When the captains from these various nations were come together at
Salamis, a council of war was summoned; and Eurybiades proposed that
any one who liked to advise, should say which place seemed to him
the fittest, among those still in the possession of the Greeks, to
be the scene of a naval combat. Attica, he said, was not to be thought
of now; but he desired their counsel as to the remainder. The speakers
mostly advised that the fleet should sail away to the Isthmus, and
there give battle in defence of the Peloponnese; and they urged as a
reason for this, that if they were worsted in a sea-fight at
Salamis, they would be shut up in an island where they could get no
help; but if they were beaten near the Isthmus, they could escape to
their homes.

As the captains from the Peloponnese were thus advising, there
came an Athenian to the camp, who brought word that the barbarians had
entered Attica, and were ravaging and burning everything. For the
division of the army under Xerxes was just arrived at Athens from
its march through Boeotia, where it had burnt Thespiae and Plataea-
both which cities were forsaken by their inhabitants, who had fled
to the Peloponnese- and now it was laying waste all the possessions of
the Athenians. Thespiae and Plataea had been burnt by the Persians,
because they knew from the Thebans that neither of those cities had
espoused their side.

Since the passage of the Hellespont and the commencement of the
march upon Greece, a space of four months had gone by; one, while
the army made the crossing, and delayed about the region of the
Hellespont; and three while they proceeded thence to Attica, which
they entered in the archonship of Calliades. They found the city
forsaken; a few people only remained in the temple, either keepers
of the treasures, or men of the poorer sort. These persons having
fortified the citadel with planks and boards, held out against the
enemy. It was in some measure their poverty which had prevented them
from seeking shelter in Salamis; but there was likewise another reason
which in part induced them to remain. They imagined themselves to have
discovered the true meaning of the oracle uttered by the Pythoness,
which promised that "the wooden wall" should never be taken- the
wooden wall, they thought, did not mean the ships, but the place where
they had taken refuge.

The Persians encamped upon the hill over against the citadel,
which is called Mars' hill by the Athenians, and began the siege of
the place, attacking the Greeks with arrows whereto pieces of
lighted tow were attached, which they shot at the barricade. And now
those who were within the citadel found themselves in a most woeful
case; for their wooden rampart betrayed them; still, however, they
continued to resist. It was in vain that the Pisistratidae came to
them and offered terms of surrender- they stoutly refused all
parley, and among their other modes of defence, rolled down huge
masses of stone upon the barbarians as they were mounting up to the
gates: so that Xerxes was for a long time very greatly perplexed,
and could not contrive any way to take them.

At last, however, in the midst of these many difficulties, the
barbarians made discovery of an access. For verily the oracle had
spoken truth; and it was fated that the whole mainland of Attica
should fall beneath the sway of the Persians. Right in front of the
citadel, but behind the gates and the common ascent- where no watch
was kept, and no one would have thought it possible that any foot of
man could climb- a few soldiers mounted from the sanctuary of
Aglaurus, Cecrops' daughter, notwithstanding the steepness of the
precipice. As soon as the Athenians saw them upon the summit, some
threw themselves headlong from the wall, and so perished; while others
fled for refuge to the inner part of the temple. The Persians rushed
to the gates and opened them, after which they massacred the
suppliants, When all were slain, they plundered the temple, and
fired every part of the citadel.

Xerxes, thus completely master of Athens, despatched a horseman to
Susa, with a message to Artabanus, informing him of his success
hitherto. The day after, he collected together all the Athenian exiles
who had come into Greece in his train, and bade them go up into the
citadel, and there offer sacrifice after their own fashion. I know not
whether he had had a dream which made him give this order, or
whether he felt some remorse on account of having set the temple on
fire. However this may have been, the exiles were not slow to obey the
command given them.

I will now explain why I have made mention of this circumstance:
there is a temple of Erechtheus the Earth-born, as he is called, in
this citadel, containing within it an olive-tree and a sea. The tale
goes among the Athenians, that they were placed there as witnesses
by Neptune and Minerva, when they had their contention about the
country. Now this olive-tree had been burnt with the rest of the
temple when the barbarians took the place. But when the Athenians,
whom the king had commanded to offer sacrifice, went up into the
temple for the purpose, they found a fresh shoot, as much as a cubit
in length, thrown out from the old trunk. Such at least was the
account which these persons gave.

Meanwhile, at Salamis, the Greeks no sooner heard what had
befallen the Athenian citadel, than they fell into such alarm that
some of the captains did not even wait for the council to come to a
vote, but embarked hastily on board their vessels, and hoisted sail as
though they would take to flight immediately. The rest, who stayed
at the council board, came to a vote that the fleet should give battle
at the Isthmus. Night now drew on; and the captains, dispersing from
the meeting, proceeded on board their respective ships.

Themistocles, as he entered his own vessel, was met by
Mnesiphilus, an Athenian, who asked him what the council had
resolved to do. On learning that the resolve was to stand away for the
Isthmus, and there give battle on behalf of the Peloponnese,
Mnesiphilus exclaimed:-

"If these men sail away from Salamis, thou wilt have no fight at
all for the one fatherland; for they will all scatter themselves to
their own homes; and neither Eurybiades nor any one else will be
able to hinder them, nor to stop the breaking up of the armament. Thus
will Greece be brought to ruin through evil counsels. But haste thee
now; and, if there be any possible way, seek to unsettle these
resolves- mayhap thou mightest persuade Eurybiades to change his mind,
and continue here."

The suggestion greatly pleased Themistocles; and without answering
a word, he went straight to the vessel of Eurybiades. Arrived there,
he let him know that he wanted to speak with him on a matter
touching the public service. So Eurybiades bade him come on board, and
say whatever he wished. Then Themistocles, seating himself at his
side, went over all the arguments which he had heard from Mnesiphilus,
pretending as if they were his own, and added to them many new ones
besides; until at last he persuaded Eurybiades, by his importunity, to
quit his ship and again collect the captains to council.

As soon as they were come, and before Eurybiades had opened to
them his purpose in assembling them together, Themistocles, as men are
wont to do when they are very anxious, spoke much to divers of them;
whereupon the Corinthian captain, Adeimantus, the son of Ocytus,
observed- "Themistocles, at the Games they who start too soon are
scourged." "True," rejoined the other in his excuse, "but they who
wait too late are not crowned."

Thus he gave the Corinthian at this time a mild answer; and
towards Eurybiades himself he did not now use any of those arguments
which he had urged before, or say aught of the allies betaking
themselves to flight if once they broke up from Salamis; it would have
been ungraceful for him, when the confederates were present, to make
accusation against any: but he had recourse to quite a new sort of
reasoning, and addressed him as follows:-

"With thee it rests, O Eurybiades! to save Greece, if thou wilt
only hearken unto me, and give the enemy battle here, rather than
yield to the advice of those among us, who would have the fleet
withdrawn to the Isthmus. Hear now, I beseech thee, and judge
between the two courses. At the Isthmus thou wilt fight in an open
sea, which is greatly to our disadvantage, since our ships are heavier
and fewer in number than the enemy's; and further, thou wilt in any
case lose Salamis, Megara, and Egina, even if all the rest goes well
with us. The land and sea force of the Persians will advance together;
and thy retreat will but draw them towards the Peloponnese, and so
bring all Greece into peril. If, on the other hand, thou doest as I
advise, these are the advantages which thou wilt so secure: in the
first place, as we shall fight in a narrow sea with few ships
against many, if the war follows the common course, we shall gain a
great victory; for to fight in a narrow space is favourable to us-
in an open sea, to them. Again, Salamis will in this case be
preserved, where we have placed our wives and children. Nay, that very
point by which ye set most store, is secured as much by this course as
by the other; for whether we fight here or at the Isthmus, we shall
equally give battle in defence of the Peloponnese. Assuredly ye will
not do wisely to draw the Persians upon that region. For if things
turn out as I anticipate, and we beat them by sea, then we shall
have kept your Isthmus free from the barbarians, and they will have
advanced no further than Attica, but from thence have fled back in
disorder; and we shall, moreover, have saved Megara, Egina, and
Salamis itself, where an oracle has said that we are to overcome our
enemies. When men counsel reasonably, reasonable success ensues; but
when in their counsels they reject reason, God does not choose to
follow the wanderings of human fancies."

When Themistocles had thus spoken, Adeimantus the Corinthian again
attacked him, and bade him be silent, since he was a man without a
city; at the same time he called on Eurybiades not to put the question
at the instance of one who had no country, and urged that Themistocles
should show of what state he was envoy, before he gave his voice
with the rest. This reproach he made, because the city of Athens had
been taken, and was in the hands of the barbarians. Hereupon
Themistocles spake many bitter things against Adeimantus and the
Corinthians generally; and for proof that he had a country, reminded
the captains, that with two hundred ships at his command, all fully
manned for battle, he had both city and territory as good as theirs;
since there was no Grecian state which could resist his men if they
were to make a descent.

After this declaration, he turned to Eurybiades, and addressing
him with still greater warmth and earnestness- "If thou wilt stay
here," he said, "and behave like a brave man, all will be well- if
not, thou wilt bring Greece to ruin. For the whole fortune of the
war depends on our ships. Be thou persuaded by my words. If not, we
will take our families on board, and go, just as we are, to Siris,
in Italy, which is ours from of old, and which the prophecies
declare we are to colonise some day or other. You then, when you
have lost allies like us, will hereafter call to mind what I have
now said."

At these words of Themistocles, Eurybiades changed his
determination; principally, as I believe, because he feared that if he
withdrew the fleet to the Isthmus, the Athenians would sail away,
and knew that without the Athenians, the rest of their ships could
be no match for the fleet of the enemy. He therefore decided to
remain, and give battle at Salamis.

And now, the different chiefs, notwithstanding their skirmish of
words, on learning the decision of Eurybiades, at once made ready
for the fight. Morning broke; and, just as the sun rose, the shock
of an earthquake was felt both on shore and at sea: whereupon the
Greeks resolved to approach the gods with prayer, and likewise to send
and invite the Aeacids to their aid. And this they did, with as much
speed as they had resolved on it. Prayers were offered to all the
gods; and Telamon and Ajax were invoked at once from Salamis, while
a ship was sent to Egina to fetch Aeacus himself, and the other
Aeacids.

The following is a tale which was told by Dicaeus, the son of
Theocydes, an Athenian, who was at this time an exile, and had
gained a good report among the Medes. He declared that after the
army of Xerxes had, in the absence of the Athenians, wasted Attica, he
chanced to be with Demaratus the Lacedaemonian in the Thriasian plain,
and that while there, he saw a cloud of dust advancing from Eleusis,
such as a host of thirty thousand men might raise. As he and his
companion were wondering who the men, from whom the dust arose,
could possibly be, a sound of voices reached his ear, and he thought
that he recognised the mystic hymn to Bacchus. Now Demaratus was
unacquainted with the rites of Eleusis, and so he inquired of
Dicaeus what the voices were saying. Dicaeus made answer- "O
Demaratus! beyond a doubt some mighty calamity is about to befall
the king's army! For it is manifest, inasmuch as Attica is deserted by
its inhabitants, that the sound which we have heard is an unearthly
one, and is now upon its way from Eleusis to aid the Athenians and
their confederates. If it descends upon the Peloponnese, danger will
threaten the king himself and his land army- if it moves towards the
ships at Salamis, 'twill go hard but the king's fleet there suffers
destruction. Every year the Athenians celebrate this feast to the
Mother and the Daughter; and all who wish, whether they be Athenians
or any other Greeks, are initiated. The sound thou hearest is the
Bacchic song, which is wont to be sung at that festival." "Hush
now," rejoined the other; "and see thou tell no man of this matter.
For if thy words be brought to the king's ear, thou wilt assuredly
lose thy head because of them; neither I nor any man living can then
save thee. Hold thy peace therefore. The gods will see to the king's
army." Thus Demaratus counselled him; and they looked, and saw the
dust, from which the sound arose, become a cloud, and the cloud rise
up into the air and sail away to Salamis, making for the station of
the Grecian fleet. Then they knew that it was the fleet of Xerxes
which would suffer destruction. Such was the tale told by Dicaeus
the son of Theocydes; and he appealed for its truth to Demaratus and
other eye-witnesses.

The men belonging to the fleet of Xerxes, after they had seen
the Spartan dead at Thermopylae, and crossed the channel from
Trachis to Histiaea, waited there by the space of three days, and then
sailing down through the Euripus, in three more came to Phalerum. In
my judgment, the Persian forces both by land and sea when they invaded
Attica were not less numerous than they had been on their arrival at
Sepias and Thermopylae. For against the Persian loss in the storm
and at Thermopylae, and again in the sea-fights off Artemisium, I
set the various nations which had since joined the king- as the
Malians, the Dorians, the Locrians, and the Boeotians- each serving in
full force in his army except the last, who did not number in their
ranks either the Thespians or the Plataeans; and together with
these, the Carystians, the Andrians, the Tenians, and the other people
of the islands, who all fought on this side except the five states
already mentioned. For as the Persians penetrated further into Greece,
they were joined continually by fresh nations.

Reinforced by the contingents of all these various states,
except Paros, the barbarians reached Athens. As for the Parians,
they tarried at Cythnus, waiting to see how the war would go. The rest
of the sea forces came safe to Phalerum; where they were visited by
Xerxes, who had conceived a desire to go aboard and learn the wishes
of the fleet. So he came and sate in a seat of honour; and the
sovereigns of the nations, and the captains of the ships, were sent
for, to appear before him, and as they arrived took their seats
according to the rank assigned them by the king. In the first seat
sate the king of Sidon; after him, the king of Tyre; then the rest
in their order. When the whole had taken their places, one after
another, and were set down in orderly array, Xerxes, to try them, sent
Mardonius and questioned each, whether a sea-fight should be risked or
no.

Mardonius accordingly went round the entire assemblage,
beginning with the Sidonian monarch, and asked this question; to which
all gave the same answer, advising to engage the Greeks, except only
Artemisia, who spake as follows (SS 1.):-

"Say to the king, Mardonius, that these are my words to him: I was
not the least brave of those who fought at Euboea, nor were my
achievements there among the meanest; it is my right, therefore, O
my lord, to tell thee plainly what I think to be most for thy
advantage now. This then is my advice. Spare thy ships, and do not
risk a battle; for these people are as much superior to thy people
in seamanship, as men to women. What so great need is there for thee
to incur hazard at sea? Art thou not master of Athens, for which
thou didst undertake thy expedition? Is not Greece subject to thee?
Not a soul now resists thy advance. They who once resisted, were
handled even as they deserved. (SS 2.) Now learn how I expect that
affairs will go with thy adversaries. If thou art not over-hasty to
engage with them by sea, but wilt keep thy fleet near the land, then
whether thou abidest as thou art, or marchest forward towards the
Peloponnese, thou wilt easily accomplish all for which thou art come
hither. The Greeks cannot hold out against thee very long; thou wilt
soon part them asunder, and scatter them to their several homes. In
the island where they lie, I hear they have no food in store; nor is
it likely, if thy land force begins its march towards the Peloponnese,
that they will remain quietly where they are- at least such as come
from that region. Of a surety they will not greatly trouble themselves
to give battle on behalf of the Athenians. (SS 3.) On the other
hand, if thou art hasty to fight, I tremble lest the defeat of thy sea
force bring harm likewise to thy land army. This, too, thou shouldst
remember, O king; good masters are apt to have bad servants, and bad
masters good ones. Now, as thou art the best of men, thy servants must
needs be a sorry set. These Egyptians, Cyprians, Cilicians, and
Pamphylians, who are counted in the number of thy subject-allies, of
how little service are they to thee!"

As Artemisia spake, they who wished her well were greatly troubled
concerning her words, thinking that she would suffer some hurt at
the king's hands, because she exhorted him not to risk a battle; they,
on the other hand, who disliked and envied her, favoured as she was by
the king above all the rest of the allies, rejoiced at her
declaration, expecting that her life would be the forfeit. But Xerxes,
when the words of the several speakers were reported to him, was
pleased beyond all others with the reply of Artemisia; and whereas,
even before this, he had always esteemed her much, he now praised
her more than ever. Nevertheless, he gave orders that the advice of
the greater number should be followed; for he thought that at Euboea
the fleet had not done its best, because he himself was not there to
see- whereas this time he resolved that he would be an eye-witness
of the combat.

Orders were now given to stand out to sea; and the ships proceeded
towards Salamis, and took up the stations to which they were directed,
without let or hindrance from the enemy. The day, however, was too far
spent for them to begin the battle, since night already approached: so
they prepared to engage upon the morrow. The Greeks, meanwhile, were
in great distress and alarm, more especially those of the Peloponnese,
who were troubled that they had been kept at Salamis to fight on
behalf of the Athenian territory, and feared that, if they should
suffer defeat, they would be pent up and besieged in an island,
while their own country was left unprotected.

The same night the land army of the barbarians began its march
towards the Peloponnese, where, however, all that was possible had
been done to prevent the enemy from forcing an entrance by land. As
soon as ever news reached the Peloponnese of the death of Leonidas and
his companions at Thermopylae, the inhabitants flocked together from
the various cities, and encamped at the Isthmus, under the command
of Cleombrotus, son of Anaxandridas, and brother of Leonidas. Here
their first care was to block up the Scironian Way; after which it was
determined in council to build a wall across the Isthmus. As the
number assembled amounted to many tens of thousands, and there was not
one who did not give himself to the work, it was soon finished.
Stones, bricks, timber, baskets filled full of sand, were used in
the building; and not a moment was lost by those who gave their aid;
for they laboured without ceasing either by night or day.

Now the nations who gave their aid, and who had flocked in full
force to the Isthmus, were the following: the Lacedaemonians, all
the tribes of the Arcadians, the Eleans, the Corinthians, the
Sicyonians, the Epidaurians, the Phliasians, the Troezenians, and
the Hermionians. These all gave their aid, being greatly alarmed at
the danger which threatened Greece. But the other inhabitants of the
Peloponnese took no part in the matter; though the Olympic and
Carneian festivals were now over.

Seven nations inhabit the Peloponnese. Two of them are aboriginal,
and still continue in the regions where they dwelt at the first- to
wit, the Arcadians and the Cynurians. A third, that of the Achaeans,
has never left the Peloponnese, but has been dislodged from its own
proper country, and inhabits a district which once belonged to others.
The remaining nations, four out of the seven, are all immigrants-
namely, the Dorians, the Aetolians, the Dryopians, and the Lemnians.
To the Dorians belong several very famous cities; to the Aetolians one
only, that is, Elis; to the Dryopians, Hermione and that Asine which
lies over against Cardamyle in Laconia; to the Lemnians, all the towns
of the Paroreats. The aboriginal Cynurians alone seem to be Ionians;
even they, however, have, in course of time, grown to be Dorians,
under the government of the Argives, whose Orneats and vassals they
were. All the cities of these seven nations, except those mentioned
above, stood aloof from the war; and by so doing, if I may speak
freely, they in fact took part with the Medes.

So the Greeks at the Isthmus toiled unceasingly, as though in
the greatest peril; since they never imagined that any great success
would be gained by the fleet. The Greeks at Salamis, on the other
hand, when they heard what the rest were about, felt greatly
alarmed; but their fear was not so much for themselves as for the
Peloponnese. At first they conversed together in low tones, each man
with his fellow, secretly, and marvelled at the folly shown by
Eurybiades; but presently the smothered feeling broke out, and another
assembly was held; whereat the old subjects provoked much talk from
the speakers, one side maintaining that it was best to sail to the
Peloponnese and risk battle for that, instead of abiding at Salamis
and fighting for a land already taken by the enemy; while the other,
which consisted of the Athenians, Eginetans, and Megarians, was urgent
to remain and have the battle fought where they were.

Then Themistocles, when he saw that the Peloponnesians would carry
the vote against him, went out secretly from the council, and,
instructing a certain man what he should say, sent him on board a
merchant ship to the fleet of the Medes. The man's name was
Sicinnus; he was one of Themistocles' household slaves, and acted as
tutor to his sons; in after times, when the Thespians were admitting
persons to citizenship, Themistocles made him a Thespian, and a rich
man to boot. The ship brought Sicinnus to the Persian fleet, and there
he delivered his message to the leaders in these words:-

"The Athenian commander has sent me to you privily, without the
knowledge of the other Greeks. He is a well-wisher to the king's
cause, and would rather success should attend on you than on his
countrymen; wherefore he bids me tell you that fear has seized the
Greeks and they are meditating a hasty flight. Now then it is open
to you to achieve the best work that ever ye wrought, if only ye
will hinder their escaping. They no longer agree among themselves,
so that they will not now make any resistance- nay, 'tis likely ye may
see a fight already begun between such as favour and such as oppose
your cause." The messenger, when he had thus expressed himself,
departed and was seen no more.

Then the captains, believing all that the messenger had said,
proceeded to land a large body of Persian troops on the islet of
Psyttaleia, which lies between Salamis and the mainland; after
which, about the hour of midnight, they advanced their western wing
towards Salamis, so as to inclose the Greeks. At the same time the
force stationed about Ceos and Cynosura moved forward, and filled
the whole strait as far as Munychia with their ships. This advance was
made to prevent the Greeks from escaping by flight, and to block
them up in Salamis, where it was thought that vengeance might be taken
upon them for the battles fought near Artemisium. The Persian troops
were landed on the islet of Psyttaleia, because, as soon as the battle
began, the men and wrecks were likely to be drifted thither, as the
isle lay in the very path of the coming fight- and they would thus
be able to save their own men and destroy those of the enemy. All
these movements were made in silence, that the Greeks might have no
knowledge of them; and they occupied the whole night, so that the
men had no time to get their sleep.

I cannot say that there is no truth in prophecies, or feel
inclined to call in question those which speak with clearness, when
I think of the following:-


When they shall bridge with their ships to the sacred strand of

  Diana

Girt with the golden falchion, and eke to marine Cynosura,

Mad hope swelling their hearts at the downfall of beautiful

  Athens

Then shall godlike Right extinguish haughty Presumption,

Insult's furious offspring, who thinketh to overthrow all things.

Brass with brass shall mingle, and Mars with blood shall empurple

Ocean's waves. Then- then shall the day of Grecia's freedom

Come from Victory fair, and Saturn's son all-seeing.

When I look to this, and perceive how clearly Bacis spoke, neither
venture myself to say anything against prophecies, nor do approve of
others impugning them.

Meanwhile, among the captains at Salamis, the strife of words grew
fierce. As yet they did not know that they were encompassed, but
imagined that the barbarians remained in the same places where they
had seen them the day before.

In the midst of their contention, Aristides, the son of
Lysimachus, who had crossed from Egina, arrived in Salamis. He was
an Athenian, and had been ostracised by the commonalty; yet I believe,
from what I have heard concerning his character, that there was not in
all Athens a man so worthy or so just as he. He now came to the
council, and, standing outside, called for Themistocles. Now
Themistocles was not his friend, but his most determined enemy.
However, under the pressure of the great dangers impending,
Aristides forgot their feud, and called Themistocles out of the
council, since he wished to confer with him. He had heard before his
arrival of the impatience of the Peloponnesians to withdraw the
fleet to the Isthmus. As soon therefore as Themistocles came forth,
Aristides addressed him in these words:-

"Our rivalry at all times, and especially at the present season,
ought to be a struggle, which of us shall most advantage our
country. Let me then say to thee, that so far as regards the departure
of the Peloponnesians from this place, much talk and little will be
found precisely alike. I have seen with my own eyes that which I now
report: that, however much the Corinthians or Eurybiades himself may
wish it, they cannot now retreat; for we are enclosed on every side by
the enemy. Go in to them, and make this known."

"Thy advice is excellent," answered the other; "and thy tidings
are also good. That which I earnestly desired to happen, thine eyes
have beheld accomplished. Know that what the Medes have now done was
at my instance; for it was necessary, as our men would not fight
here of their own free will, to make them fight whether they would
or no. But come now, as thou hast brought the good news, go in and
tell it. For if I speak to them, they will think it a feigned tale,
and will not believe that the barbarians have inclosed us around.
Therefore do thou go to them, and inform them how matters stand. If
they believe thee, 'twill be for the best; but if otherwise, it will
not harm. For it is impossible that they should now flee away, if we
are indeed shut in on all sides, as thou sayest."

Then Aristides entered the assembly, and spoke to the captains: he
had come, he told them, from Egina, and had but barely escaped the
blockading vessels- the Greek fleet was entirely inclosed by the ships
of Xerxes- and he advised them to get themselves in readiness to
resist the foe. Having said so much, he withdrew. And now another
contest arose; for the greater part of the captains would not
believe the tidings.

But while they still doubted, a Tenian trireme, commanded by
Panaetius the son of Sosimenes, deserted from the Persians and
joined the Greeks, bringing full intelligence. For this reason the
Tenians were inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi among those who
overthrew the barbarians. With this ship, which deserted to their side
at Salamis, and the Lemnian vessel which came over before at
Artemisium, the Greek fleet was brought to the full number of 380
ships; otherwise it fell short by two of that amount.

The Greeks now, not doubting what the Tenians told them, made
ready for the coming fight. At the dawn of day, all the men-at-arms
were assembled together, and speeches were made to them, of which
the best was that of Themistocles; who throughout contrasted what
was noble with what was base, and bade them, in all that came within
the range of man's nature and constitution, always to make choice of
the nobler part. Having thus wound up his discourse, he told them to
go at once on board their ships, which they accordingly did; and about
his time the trireme, that had been sent to Egina for the Aeacidae,
returned; whereupon the Greeks put to sea with all their fleet.

The fleet had scarce left the land when they were attacked by
the barbarians. At once most of the Greeks began to back water, and
were about touching the shore, when Ameinias of Palline, one of the
Athenian captains, darted forth in front of the line, and charged a
ship of the enemy. The two vessels became entangled, and could not
separate, whereupon the rest of the fleet came up to help Ameinias,
and engaged with the Persians. Such is the account which the Athenians
give of the way in which the battle began; but the Eginetans
maintain that the vessel which had been to Egina for the Aeacidae, was
the one that brought on the fight. It is also reported, that a phantom
in the form of a woman appeared to the Greeks, and, in a voice that
was heard from end to end of the fleet, cheered them on to the
fight; first, however, rebuking them, and saying- "Strange men, how
long are ye going to back water?"

Against the Athenians, who held the western extremity of the
line towards Eleusis, were placed the Phoenicians; against the
Lacedaemonians, whose station was eastward towards the Piraeus, the
Ionians. Of these last a few only followed the advice of Themistocles,
to fight backwardly; the greater number did far otherwise. I could
mention here the names of many trierarchs who took vessels from the
Greeks, but I shall pass over all excepting Theomestor, the son of
Androdamas, and Phylacus, the son of Histiaeus, both Samians. I show
this preference to them, inasmuch as for this service Theomestor was
made tyrant of Samos by the Persians, which Phylacus was enrolled
among the king's benefactors, and presented with a large estate in
land. In the Persian tongue the king's benefactors are called
Orosangs.

Far the greater number of the Persian ships engaged in this battle
were disabled, either by the Athenians or by the Eginetans. For as the
Greeks fought in order and kept their line, while the barbarians
were in confusion and had no plan in anything that they did, the issue
of the battle could scarce be other than it was. Yet the Persians
fought far more bravely here than at Euboea, and indeed surpassed
themselves; each did his utmost through fear of Xerxes, for each
thought that the king's eye was upon himself.

What part the several nations, whether Greek or barbarian, took in
the combat, I am not able to say for certain; Artemisia, however, I
know, distinguished herself in such a way as raised her even higher
than she stood before in the esteem of the king. For after confusion
had spread throughout the whole of the king's fleet, and her ship
was closely pursued by an Athenian trireme, she, having no way to fly,
since in front of her were a number of friendly vessels, and she was
nearest of all the Persians to the enemy, resolved on a measure
which in fact proved her safety. Pressed by the Athenian pursuer,
she bore straight against one of the ships of her own party, a
Calyndian, which had Damasithymus, the Calyndian king, himself on
board. I cannot say whether she had had any quarrel with the man while
the fleet was at the Hellespont, or no- neither can I decide whether
she of set purpose attacked his vessel, or whether it merely chanced
that the Calyndian ship came in her way- but certain it is that she
bore down upon his vessel and sank it, and that thereby she had the
good fortune to procure herself a double advantage. For the
commander of the Athenian trireme, when he saw her bear down on one of
the enemy's fleet, thought immediately that her vessel was a Greek, or
else had deserted from the Persians, and was now fighting on the Greek
side; he therefore gave up the chase, and turned away to attack
others.

Thus in the first place she saved her life by the action, and
was enabled to get clear off from the battle; while further, it fell
out that in the very act of doing the king an injury she raised
herself to a greater height than ever in his esteem. For as Xerxes
beheld the fight, he remarked (it is said) the destruction of the
vessel, whereupon the bystanders observed to him- "Seest thou, master,
how well Artemisia fights, and how she has just sunk a ship of the
enemy?" Then Xerxes asked if it were really Artemisia's doing; and
they answered, "Certainly; for they knew her ensign": while all made
sure that the sunken vessel belonged to the opposite side. Everything,
it is said, conspired to prosper the queen- it was especially
fortunate for her that not one of those on board the Calyndian ship
survived to become her accuser. Xerxes, they say, in reply to the
remarks made to him, observed- "My men have behaved like women, my
women like men!"

There fell in this combat Ariabignes, one of the chief
commanders of the fleet, who was son of Darius and brother of
Xerxes; and with him perished a vast number of men of high repute,
Persians, Medes, and allies. Of the Greeks there died only a few; for,
as they were able to swim, all those that were not slain outright by
the enemy escaped from the sinking vessels and swam across to Salamis.
But on the side of the barbarians more perished by drowning than in
any other way, since they did not know how to swim. The great
destruction took place when the ships which had been first engaged
began to fly; for they who were stationed in the rear, anxious to
display their valour before the eyes of the king, made every effort to
force their way to the front, and thus became entangled with such of
their own vessels as were retreating.

In this confusion the following event occurred: certain
Phoenicians belonging to the ships which had thus perished made
their appearance before the king, and laid the blame of their loss
on the Ionians, declaring that they were traitors, and had wilfully
destroyed the vessels. But the upshot of this complaint was that the
Ionian captains escaped the death which threatened them, while their
Phoenician accusers received death as their reward. For it happened
that, exactly as they spoke, a Samothracian vessel bore down on an
Athenian and sank it, but was attacked and crippled immediately by one
of the Eginetan squadron. Now the Samothracians were expert with the
javelin, and aimed their weapons so well, that they cleared the deck
of the vessel which had disabled their own, after which they sprang on
board, and took it. This saved the Ionians. Xerxes, when he saw the
exploit, turned fiercely on the Phoenicians- (he was ready, in his
extreme vexation, to find fault with any one)- and ordered their heads
to be cut off, to prevent them, he said, from casting the blame of
their own misconduct upon braver men. During the whole time of the
battle Xerxes sate at the base of the hill called Aegaleos, over
against Salamis; and whenever he saw any of his own captains perform
any worthy exploit he inquired concerning him; and the man's name
was taken down by his scribes, together with the names of his father
and his city. Ariaramnes too, a Persian, who was a friend of the
Ionians, and present at the time whereof I speak, had a share in
bringing about the punishment of the Phoenicians.

When the rout of the barbarians began, and they sought to make
their escape to Phalerum, the Eginetans, awaiting them in the channel,
performed exploits worthy to be recorded. Through the whole of the
confused struggle the Athenians employed themselves in destroying such
ships as either made resistance or fled to shore, while the
Eginetans dealt with those which endeavoured to escape down the
strait; so that the Persian vessels were no sooner clear of the
Athenians than forthwith they fell into the hands of the Eginetan
squadron.

It chanced here that there was a meeting between the ship of
Themistocles, which was hasting in pursuit of the enemy, and that of
Polycritus, son of Crius the Eginetan, which had just charged a
Sidonian trireme. The Sidonian vessel was the same that captured the
Eginetan guard-ship off Sciathus, which had Pythias, the son of
Ischenous, on board- that Pythias, I mean, who fell covered with
wounds, and whom the Sidonians kept on board their ship, from
admiration of his gallantry. This man afterwards returned in safety to
Egina; for when the Sidonian vessel with its Persian crew fell into
the hands of the Greeks, he was still found on board. Polycritus no
sooner saw the Athenian trireme than, knowing at once whose vessel
it was, as he observed that it bore the ensign of the admiral, he
shouted to Themistocles jeeringly, and asked him, in a tone of
reproach, if the Eginetans did not show themselves rare friends to the
Medes. At the same time, while he thus reproached Themistocles,
Polycritus bore straight down on the Sidonian. Such of the barbarian
vessels as escaped from the battle fled to Phalerum, and there
sheltered themselves under the protection of the land army.

The Greeks who gained the greatest glory of all in the sea-fight
off Salamis were the Eginetans, and after them the Athenians. The
individuals of most distinction were Polycritus the Eginetan, and
two Athenians, Eumenes of Anagyrus, and Ameinias of Palline; the
latter of whom had pressed Artemisia so hard. And assuredly, if he had
known that the vessel carried Artemisia on board, he would never
have given over the chase till he had either succeeded in taking
her, or else been taken himself. For the Athenian captains had
received special orders touching the queen; and moreover a reward of
ten thousand drachmas had been proclaimed for any one who should
make her prisoner; since there was great indignation felt that a woman
should appear in arms against Athens. However, as I said before, she
escaped; and so did some others whose ships survived the engagement;
and these were all now assembled at the port of Phalerum.

The Athenians say that Adeimantus, the Corinthian commander, at
the moment when the two fleets joined battle, was seized with fear,
and being beyond measure alarmed, spread his sails, and hasted to
fly away; on which the other Corinthians, seeing their leader's ship
in full flight, sailed off likewise. They had reached in their
flight that part of the coast of Salamis where stands the temple of
Minerva Sciras, when they met a light bark, a very strange apparition:
it was never discovered that any one had sent it to them; and till
it appeared they were altogether ignorant how the battle was going.
That there was something beyond nature in the matter they judged
from this- that when the men in the bark drew near to their ships they
addressed them, saying- "Adeimantus, while thou playest the
traitor's part, by withdrawing all these ships, and flying away from
the fight, the Greeks whom thou hast deserted are defeating their foes
as completely as they ever wished in their prayers." Adeimantus,
however, would not believe what the men said; whereupon they told
him "he might take them with him as hostages, and put them to death if
he did not find the Greeks winning." Then Adeimantus put about, both
he and those who were with him; and they re-joined the fleet when
the victory was already gained. Such is the tale which the Athenians
tell concerning them of Corinth; these latter however do not allow its
truth. On the contrary, they declare that they were among those who
distinguished themselves most in the fight. And the rest of Greece
bears witness in their favour.

In the midst of the confusion Aristides, the son of Lysimachus,
the Athenian, of whom I lately spoke as a man of the greatest
excellence, performed the following service. He took a number of the
Athenian heavy-armed troops, who had previously been stationed along
the shore of Salamis, and, landing with them on the islet of
Psyttaleia, slew all the Persians by whom it was occupied.

As soon as the sea-fight was ended, the Greeks drew together to
Salamis all the wrecks that were to be found in that quarter, and
prepared themselves for another engagement, supposing that the king
would renew the fight with the vessels which still remained to him.
Many of the wrecks had been carried away by a westerly wind to the
coast of Attica, where they were thrown upon the strip of shore called
Colias. Thus not only were the prophecies of Bacis and Musaeus
concerning this battle fulfilled completely, but likewise, by the
place to which the wrecks were drifted, the prediction of Lysistratus,
an Athenian soothsayer, uttered many years before these events, and
quite forgotten at the time by all the Greeks, was fully accomplished.
The words were-


Then shall the sight of the oars fill Colian dames with

  amazement.

Now this must have happened as soon as the king was departed.

Xerxes, when he saw the extent of his loss, began to be afraid
lest the Greeks might be counselled by the Ionians, or without their
advice might determine to sail straight to the Hellespont and break
down the bridges there; in which case he would be blocked up in
Europe, and run great risk of perishing. He therefore made up his mind
to fly; but, as he wished to hide his purpose alike from the Greeks
and from his own people, he set to work to carry a mound across the
channel to Salamis, and at the same time began fastening a number of
Phoenician merchant ships together, to serve at once for a bridge
and a wall. He likewise made many warlike preparations, as if he
were about to engage the Greeks once more at sea. Now, when these
things were seen, all grew fully persuaded that the king was bent on
remaining, and intended to push the war in good earnest. Mardonius,
however, was in no respect deceived; for long acquaintance enabled him
to read all the king's thoughts. Meanwhile, Xerxes, though engaged
in this way, sent off a messenger to carry intelligence of his
misfortune to Persia.

Nothing mortal travels so fast as these Persian messengers. The
entire plan is a Persian invention; and this is the method of it.
Along the whole line of road there are men (they say) stationed with
horses, in number equal to the number of days which the journey takes,
allowing a man and horse to each day; and these men will not be
hindered from accomplishing at their best speed the distance which
they have to go, either by snow, or rain, or heat, or by the
darkness of night. The first rider delivers his despatch to the second
and the second passes it to the third; and so it is borne from hand to
hand along the whole line, like the light in the torch-race, which the
Greeks celebrate to Vulcan. The Persians give the riding post in
this manner, the name of "Angarum."

At Susa, on the arrival of the first message, which said that
Xerxes was master of Athens, such was the delight of the Persians
who had remained behind, that they forthwith strewed all the streets
with myrtle boughs, and burnt incense, and fell to feasting and
merriment. In like manner, when the second message reached them, so
sore was their dismay, that they all with one accord rent their
garments, and cried aloud, and wept and wailed without stint. They
laid the blame of the disaster on Mardonius; and their grief on the
occasion was less on account of the damage done to their ships, than
owing to the alarm which they felt about the safety of the king. Hence
their trouble did not cease till Xerxes himself, by his arrival, put
an end to their fears.

And now Mardonius, perceiving that Xerxes took the defeat of his
fleet greatly to heart, and suspecting that he had made up his mind to
leave Athens and fly away, began to think of the likelihood of his
being visited with punishment for having persuaded the king to
undertake the war. He therefore considered that it would be the best
thing for him to adventure further, and either become the conqueror of
Greece- which was the result he rather expected- or else die
gloriously after aspiring to a noble achievement. So with these
thoughts in his mind, he said one day to the king:-

"Do not grieve, master, or take so greatly to heart thy late loss.
Our hopes hang not altogether on the fate of a few planks, but on
our brave steeds and horsemen. These fellows, whom thou imaginest to
have quite conquered us, will not venture- no, not one of them- to
come ashore and contend with our land army; nor will the Greeks who
are upon the mainland fight our troops; such as did so have received
their punishment. If thou so pleasest, we may at once attack the
Peloponnese; if thou wouldst rather wait a while, that too is in our
power. Only be not disheartened. For it is not possible that the
Greeks can avoid being brought to account, alike for this and for
their former injuries; nor can they anyhow escape being thy slaves.
Thou shouldst therefore do as I have said. If, however, thy mind is
made up, and thou art resolved to retreat and lead away thy army,
listen to the counsel which, in that case, I have to offer. Make not
the Persians, O king! a laughing-stock to the Greeks. If thy affairs
have succeeded ill, it has not been by their fault; thou canst not say
that thy Persians have ever shown themselves cowards. What matters
it if Phoenicians and Egyptians, Cyprians and Cilicians, have
misbehaved?- their misconduct touches not us. Since then thy
Persians are without fault, be advised by me. Depart home, if thou art
so minded, and take with thee the bulk of thy army; but first let me
choose out 300,000 troops, and let it be my task to bring Greece
beneath thy sway."

Xerxes, when he heard these words, felt a sense of joy and
delight, like a man who is relieved from care. Answering Mardonius,
therefore, "that he would consider his counsel, and let him know which
course he might prefer," Xerxes proceeded to consult with the chief
men among the Persians; and because Artemisia on the former occasion
had shown herself the only person who knew what was best to be done,
he was pleased to summon her to advise him now. As soon as she
arrived, he put forth all the rest, both councillors and bodyguards,
and said to her:-

"Mardonius wishes me to stay and attack the Peloponnese. My
Persians, he says, and my other land forces, are not to blame for
the disasters which have befallen our arms; and of this he declares
they would very gladly give me the proof. He therefore exhorts me,
either to stay and act as I have said, or to let him choose Out
300,000 of my troops- wherewith he undertakes to reduce Greece beneath
my sway- while I myself retire with the rest of my forces, and
withdraw into my own country. Do thou, therefore, as thou didst
counsel me so wisely to decline the sea-fight, now also advise me in
this matter, and say, which course of the twain I ought to take for my
own good."

Thus did the king ask Artemisia's counsel; and the following are
the words wherewith she answered him:-

"'Tis a hard thing, O king! to give the best possible advice to
one who asks our counsel. Nevertheless, as thy affairs now stand, it
seemeth to me that thou wilt do right to return home. As for
Mardonius, if he prefers to remain, and undertakes to do as he has
said, leave him behind by all means, with the troops which he desires.
If his design succeeds, and he subdues the Greeks, as he promises,
thine is the conquest, master; for thy slaves will have accomplished
it. If, on the other hand, affairs run counter to his wishes, we can
suffer no great loss, so long as thou art safe, and thy house is in no
danger. The Greeks, too, while thou livest, and thy house
flourishes, must be prepared to fight full many a battle for their
freedom; whereas if Mardonius fall, it matters nothing- they will have
gained but a poor triumph- a victory over one of thy slaves!
Remember also, thou goest home having gained the purpose of thy
expedition; for thou hast burnt Athens!"

The advice of Artemisia pleased Xerxes well; for she had exactly
uttered his own thoughts. I, for my part, do not believe that he would
have remained had all his counsellors, both men and women, united to
urge his stay, so great was the alarm that he felt. As it was, he gave
praise to Artemisia, and entrusted certain of his children to her
care, ordering her to convey them to Ephesus; for he had been
accompanied on the expedition by some of his natural sons.

He likewise sent away at this time one of the principal of his
eunuchs, a man named Hermotimus, a Pedasian, who was bidden to take
charge of these sons. Now the Pedasians inhabit the region above
Halicarnassus; and it is related of them, that in their country the
following circumstance happens: when a mischance is about to befall
any of their neighbours within a certain time, the priestess of
Minerva in their city grows a long beard. This has already taken place
on two occasions.

The Hermotimus of whom I spoke above was, as I said, a Pedasian;
and he, of all men whom we know, took the most cruel vengeance on
the person who had done him an injury. He had been made a prisoner
of war, and when his captors sold him, he was bought by a certain
Panionius, a native of Chios, who made his living by a most
nefarious traffic. Whenever he could get any boys of unusual beauty,
he made them eunuchs, and, carrying them to Sardis or Ephesus, sold
them for large sums of money. For the barbarians value eunuchs more
than others, since they regard them as more trustworthy. Many were the
slaves that Panionius, who made his living by the practice, had thus
treated; and among them was this Hermotimus of whom I have here made
mention. However, he was not without his share of good fortune; for
after a while he was sent from Sardis, together with other gifts, as a
present to the king. Nor was it long before he came to be esteemed
by Xerxes more highly than all his eunuchs.

When the king was on his way to Athens with the Persian army,
and abode for a time at Sardis, Hermotimus happened to make a
journey upon business into Mysia; and there, in a district which is
called Atarneus, but belongs to Chios, he chanced to fall in with
Panionius. Recognising him at once, he entered into a long and
friendly talk with him, wherein he counted up the numerous blessings
he enjoyed through his means, and promised him all manner of favours
in return, if he would bring his household to Sardis and live there.
Panionius was overjoyed, and, accepting the offer made him, came
presently, and brought with him his wife and children. Then
Hermotimus, when he had got Panionius and all his family into his
power, addressed him in these words:-

"Thou man, who gettest a living by viler deeds than any one else
in the whole world, what wrong to thee or thine had I or any of mine
done, that thou shouldst have made me the nothing that I now am? Ah!
surely thou thoughtest that the gods took no note of thy crimes. But
they in their justice have delivered thee, the doer of
unrighteousness, into my hands; and now thou canst not complain of the
vengeance which I am resolved to take on thee."

After these reproaches, Hermotimus commanded the four sons of
Panionius to be brought, and forced the father to make them eunuchs
with his own hand. Unable to resist, he did as Hermotimus required;
and then his sons were made to treat him in the self-same way. So in
this way there came to Panionius requital at the hands of Hermotimus.

Xerxes, after charging Artemisia to convey his sons safe to
Ephesus, sent for Mardonius, and bade him choose from all his army
such men as he wished, and see that he made his achievements answer to
his promises. During this day he did no more; but no sooner was
night come, than he issued his orders, and at once the captains of the
ships left Phalerum, and bore away for the Hellespont, each making all
the speed he could, and hasting to guard the bridges against the
king's return. On their way, as they sailed by Zoster, where certain
narrow points of land project into the sea, they took the cliffs for
vessels, and fled far away in alarm. Discovering their mistake,
however, after a time, they joined company once more, and proceeded
upon their voyage.

Next day the Greeks, seeing the land force of the barbarians
encamped in the same place, thought that their ships must still be
lying at Phalerum; and, expecting another attack from that quarter,
made preparations to defend themselves. Soon however news came that
the ships were all departed and gone away; whereupon it was
instantly resolved to make sail in pursuit. They went as far as
Andros; but, seeing nothing of the Persian fleet, they stopped at that
place, and held a council of war. At this council Themistocles advised
that the Greeks should follow on through the islands, still pressing
the pursuit, and making all haste to the Hellespont, there to break
down the bridges. Eurybiades, however, delivered a contrary opinion.
"If," he said, "the Greeks should break down the bridges, it would
be the worst thing that could possibly happen for Greece. The Persian,
supposing that his retreat were cut off, and he compelled to remain in
Europe, would be sure never to give them any peace. Inaction on his
part would ruin all his affairs, and leave him no chance of ever
getting back to Asia- nay, would even cause his army to perish by
famine: whereas, if he bestirred himself, and acted vigorously, it was
likely that the whole of Europe would in course of time become subject
to him; since, by degrees, the various towns and tribes would either
fall before his arms, or else agree to terms of submission; and in
this way, his troops would find food sufficient for them, since each
year the Greek harvest would be theirs. As it was, the Persian,
because he had lost the sea-fight, intended evidently to remain no
longer in Europe. The Greeks ought to let him depart; and when he
was gone from among them, and had returned into his own country,
then would be the time for them to contend with him for the possession
of that."

The other captains of the Peloponnesians declared themselves of
the same mind.

Whereupon Themistocles, finding that the majority was against him,
and that he could not persuade them to push on to the Hellespont,
changed round, and addressing himself to the Athenians, who of all the
allies were the most nettled at the enemy's escape, and who eagerly
desired, if the other Greeks would not stir, to sail on by
themselves to the Hellespont and break the bridges, spake as follows:-

"I have often myself witnessed occasions, and I have heard of many
more from others, where men who had been conquered by an enemy, having
been driven quite to desperation, have renewed the fight, and
retrieved their former disasters. We have now had the great good
luck to save both ourselves and all Greece by the repulse of this vast
cloud of men; let us then be content and not press them too hard,
now that they have begun to fly. Be sure we have not done this by
our own might. It is the work of gods and heroes, who were jealous
that one man should be king at once of Europe and of Asia- more
especially a man like this, unholy and presumptuous- a man who esteems
alike things sacred and things profane; who has cast down and burnt
the very images of the gods themselves; who even caused the sea to
be scourged with rods and commanded fetters to be thrown into it. At
present all is well with us- let us then abide in Greece, and look
to ourselves and to our families. The barbarian is clean gone- we have
driven him off- let each now repair his own house, and sow his land
diligently. In the spring we will take ship and sail to the Hellespont
and to Ionia!" All this Themistocles said in the hope of
establishing a claim upon the king; for he wanted to have a safe
retreat in case any mischance should befall him at Athens- which
indeed came to pass afterwards.

At present, however, he dissembled; and the Athenians were
persuaded by his words. For they were ready now to do whatever he
advised; since they had always esteemed him a wise man, and he had
lately proved himself most truly wise and well-judging. Accordingly,
they came in to his views; whereupon he lost no time in sending
messengers, on board a light bark, to the king, choosing for this
purpose men whom he could trust to keep his instructions secret,
even although they should be put to every kind of torture. Among
them was the house-slave Sicinnus, the same whom he had made use of
previously. When the men reached Attica, all the others stayed with
the boat; but Sicinnus went up to the king, and spake to him as
follows:-

"I am sent to thee by Themistocles, the son of Neocles, who is the
leader of the Athenians, and the wisest and bravest man of all the
allies, to bear thee this message: 'Themistocles the Athenian, anxious
to render thee a service, has restrained the Greeks, who were
impatient to pursue thy ships, and to break up the bridges at the
Hellespont. Now, therefore, return home at thy leisure.'"

The messengers, when they had performed their errand, sailed
back to the fleet.

And the Greeks, having resolved that they would neither proceed
further in pursuit of the barbarians, nor push forward to the
Hellespont and destroy the passage, laid siege to Andros, intending to
take the town by storm. For Themistocles had required the Andrians
to pay down a sum of money; and they had refused, being the first of
all the islanders who did so. To his declaration, "that the money must
needs be paid, as the Athenians had brought with him two mighty
gods- Persuasion and Necessity," they made reply, that "Athens might
well be a great and glorious city, since she was blest with such
excellent gods; but they were wretchedly poor, stinted for land, and
cursed with two unprofitable gods, who always dwelt with them and
would never quit their island- to wit, Poverty and Helplessness. These
were the gods of the Andrians, and therefore they would not pay the
money. For the power of Athens could not possibly be stronger than
their inability." This reply, coupled with the refusal to pay the
sum required, caused their city to be besieged by the Greeks.

Meanwhile Themistocles, who never ceased his pursuit of gain, sent
threatening messages to the other islanders with demands for different
sums, employing the same messengers and the same words as he had
used towards the Andrians. "If," he said, "they did not send him the
amount required, he would bring the Greek fleet upon them, and besiege
them till he took their cities." By these means he collected large
sums from the Carystians and the Parians, who, when they heard that
Andros was already besieged, and that Themistocles was the best
esteemed of all the captains, sent the money through fear. Whether any
of the other islanders did the like, I cannot say for certain; but I
think some did besides those I have mentioned. However, the
Carystians, though they complied, were not spared any the more; but
Themistocles was softened by the Parians' gift, and therefore they
received no visit from the army. In this way it was that Themistocles,
during his stay at Andros, obtained money from the islanders,
unbeknown to the other captains.

King Xerxes and his army waited but a few days after the
sea-fight, and then withdrew into Boeotia by the road which they had
followed on their advance. It was the wish of Mardonius to escort
the king a part of the way; and as the time of year was no longer
suitable for carrying on war, he thought it best to winter in
Thessaly, and wait for the spring before he attempted the Peloponnese.
After the army was come into Thessaly, Mardonius made choice of the
troops that were to stay with him; and, first of all, he took the
whole body called the "Immortals," except only their leader, Hydarnes,
who refused to quit the person of the king. Next, he chose the
Persians who wore breastplates, and the thousand picked horse;
likewise the Medes, the Sacans, the Bactrians, and the Indians, foot
and horse equally. These nations he took entire: from the rest of
the allies he culled a few men, taking either such as were
remarkable for their appearance, or else such as had performed, to his
knowledge, some valiant deed. The Persians furnished him with the
greatest number of troops, men who were adorned with chains and
armlets. Next to them were the Medes, who in number equalled the
Persians, but in valour fell short of them. The whole army,
reckoning the horsemen with the rest, amounted to 300,000 men.

At the time when Mardonius was making choice of his troops, and
Xerxes still continued in Thessaly, the Lacedaemonians received a
message from the Delphic oracle, bidding them seek satisfaction at the
hands of Xerxes for the death of Leonidas, and take whatever he
chose to give them. So the Spartans sent a herald with all speed
into Thessaly, who arrived while the entire Persian army was still
there. This man, being brought before the king, spake as follows:-

"King of the Medes, the Lacedaemonians and the Heracleids of
Sparta require of thee the satisfaction due for bloodshed, because
thou slewest their king, who fell fighting for Greece."

Xerxes laughed, and for a long time spake not a word. At last,
however, he pointed to Mardonius, who was standing by him, and
said:- "Mardonius here shall give them the satisfaction they deserve
to get." And the herald accepted the answer, and forthwith went his
way.

Xerxes, after this, left Mardonius in Thessaly, and marched away
himself, at his best speed, toward the Hellespont. In five-and-forty
days he reached the place of passage, where he arrived with scarce a
fraction, so to speak, of his former army. All along their line of
march, in every country where they chanced to be, his soldiers
seized and devoured whatever corn they could find belonging to the
inhabitants; while, if no corn was to be found, they gathered the
grass that grew in the fields, and stripped the trees, whether
cultivated or wild, alike of their bark and of their leaves, and so
fed themselves. They left nothing anywhere, so hard were they
pressed by hunger. Plague too and dysentery attacked the troops
while still upon their march, and greatly thinned their ranks. Many
died; others fell sick and were left behind in the different cities
that lay upon the route, the inhabitants being strictly charged by
Xerxes to tend and feed them. Of these some remained in Thessaly,
others in Siris of Paeonia, others again in Macedon. Here Xerxes, on
his march into Greece, had left the sacred car and steeds of Jove;
which upon his return he was unable to recover; for the Paeonians
had disposed of them to the Thracians, and, when Xerxes demanded
them back, they said that the Thracian tribes who dwelt about the
sources of the Strymon had stolen the mares as they pastured.

Here too a Thracian chieftain, king of the Bisaltians and of
Crestonia, did a deed which went beyond nature. He had refused to
become the willing slave of Xerxes, and had fled before him into the
heights of Rhodope, at the same time forbidding his sons to take
part in the expedition against Greece. But they, either because they
cared little for his orders, or because they wished greatly to see the
war, joined the army of Xerxes. At this time they had all returned
home to him- the number of the men was six- quite safe and sound.
But their father took them, and punished their offence by plucking out
their eyes from the sockets. Such was the treatment which these men
received.

The Persians, having journeyed through Thrace and reached the
passage, entered their ships hastily and crossed the Hellespont to
Abydos. The bridges were not found stretched across the strait;
since a storm had broken and dispersed them. At Abydos the troops
halted, and, obtaining more abundant provision than they had yet got
upon their march, they fed without stint; from which cause, added to
the change in their water, great numbers of those who had hitherto
escaped perished. The remainder, together with Xerxes himself, came
safe to Sardis.

There is likewise another account given of the return of the king.
It is said that when Xerxes on his way from Athens arrived at Eion
upon the Strymon, he gave up travelling by land, and, intrusting
Hydarnes with the conduct of his forces to the Hellespont, embarked
himself on board a Phoenician ship, and so crossed into Asia. On his
voyage the ship was assailed by a strong wind blowing from the mouth
of the Strymon, which caused the sea to run high. As the storm
increased, and the ship laboured heavily, because of the number of the
Persians who had come in the king's train, and who now crowded the
deck, Xerxes was seized with fear, and called out to the helmsman in a
loud voice, asking him, if there were any means whereby they might
escape the danger. "No means, master," the helmsman answered,
"unless we could be quit of these too numerous passengers." Xerxes,
they say, on hearing this, addressed the Persians as follows: "Men
of Persia," he said, "now is the time for you to show what love ye
bear your king. My safety, as it seems, depends wholly upon you." So
spake the king; and the Persians instantly made obeisance, and then
leapt over into the sea. Thus was the ship lightened, and Xerxes got
safe to Asia. As soon as he had reached the shore, he sent for the
helmsman, and gave him a golden crown because he had preserved the
life of the kings- but because he had caused the death of a number
of Persians, he ordered his head to be struck from his shoulders.

Such is the other account which is given of the return of
Xerxes; but to me it seems quite unworthy of belief, alike in other
respects, and in what relates to the Persians. For had the helmsman
made any such speech to Xerxes, I suppose there is not one man in
ten thousand who will doubt that this is the course which the king
would have followed:- he would have made the men upon the ship's deck,
who were not only Persians, but Persians of the very highest rank,
quit their place and go down below; and would have cast into the sea
an equal number of the rowers, who were Phoenicians. But the truth is,
that the king, as I have already said, returned into Asia by the
same road as the rest of the army.

I will add a strong proof of this. It is certain that Xerxes on
his way back from Greece passed through Abdera, where he made a
contract of friendship with the inhabitants, and presented them with a
golden scymitar, and a tiara broidered with gold. The Abderites
declare- but I put no faith in this part of their story- that from the
time of the king's leaving Athens, he never once loosed his girdle
till he came to their city, since it was not till then that he felt
himself in safety. Now Abdera is nearer to the Hellespont than Eion
and the Strymon, where Xerxes, according to the other tale, took ship.

Meanwhile the Greeks, finding that they could not capture
Andros, sailed away to Carystus, and wasted the lands of the
Carystians, after which they returned to Salamis. Arrived here, they
proceeded, before entering on any other matter, to make choice of
the first-fruits which should be set apart as offerings to the gods.
These consisted of divers gifts; among them were three Phoenician
triremes, one of which was dedicated at the Isthmus, where it
continued to my day; another at Sunium; and the third, at Salamis
itself, which was devoted to Ajax. This done, they made a division
of the booty, and sent away the first-fruits to Delphi. Thereof was
made the statue, holding in its hand the beak of a ship, which is
twelve cubits high, and which stands in the same place with the golden
one of Alexander the Macedonian.

After the first-fruits had been sent to Delphi, the Greeks made
inquiry of the god, in the name of their whole body, if he had
received his full share of the spoils and was satisfied therewith. The
god made answer that all the other Greeks had paid him his full due,
except only the Eginetans; on them he had still a claim for the
prize of valour which they had gained at Salamis. So the Eginetans,
when they heard this, dedicated the three golden stars which stand
on the top of a bronze mast in the corner near the bowl offered by
Croesus.

When the spoils had been divided, the Greeks sailed to the
Isthmus, where a prize of valour was to be awarded to the man who,
of all the Greeks, had shown the most merit during the war. When the
chiefs were all come, they met at the altar of Neptune, and took the
ballots wherewith they were to give their votes for the first and
for the second in merit. Then each man gave himself the first vote,
since each considered that he was himself the worthiest; but the
second votes were given chiefly to Themistocies. In this way, while
the others received but one vote apiece, Themistocles had for the
second prize a large majority of the suffrages.

Envy, however, hindered the chiefs from coming to a decision,
and they all sailed away to their homes without making any award.
Nevertheless Themistocles was regarded everywhere as by far the wisest
man of all the Greeks; and the whole country rang with his fame. As
the chiefs who fought at Salamis, notwithstanding that he was really
entitled to the prize, had withheld his honour from him, he went
without delay to Lacedaemon, in the hope that he would be honoured
there. And the Lacedaemonians received him handsomely, and paid him
great respect. The prize of valour indeed, which was a crown of olive,
they gave to Eurybiades; but Themistocles was given a crown of olive
too, as the prize of wisdom and dexterity. He was likewise presented
with the most beautiful chariot that could be found in Sparta; and
after receiving abundant praises, was, upon his departure, escorted as
far as the borders of Tegea, by the three hundred picked Spartans, who
are called the Knights. Never was it known, either before or since,
that the Spartans escorted a man out of their city.

On the return of Themistocles to Athens, Timodemus of Aphidnae,
who was one of his enemies, but otherwise a man of no repute, became
so maddened with envy that he openly railed against him, and,
reproaching him with his journey to Sparta, said- "'Twas not his own
merit that had won him honour from the men of Lacedaemon, but the fame
of Athens, his country." Then Themistocles, seeing that Timodemus
repeated this phrase unceasingly, replied-

"Thus stands the case, friend. I had never got this honour from
the Spartans, had I been a Belbinite- nor thou, hadst thou been an
Athenian!"

Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, a man whom the Persians had
always held in much esteem, but who, after the affair of Plataea, rose
still higher in their opinion, escorted King Xerxes as far as the
strait, with sixty thousand of the chosen troops of Mardonius. When
the king was safe in Asia, Artabazus set out upon his return; and on
arriving near Palline, and finding that Mardonius had gone into
winter-quarters in Thessaly and Macedonia, and was in no hurry for him
to join the camp, he thought it his bounden duty, as the Potidaeans
had just revolted, to occupy himself in reducing them to slavery.
For as soon as the king had passed beyond their territory, and the
Persian fleet had made its hasty flight from Salamis, the Potidaeans
revolted from the barbarians openly; as likewise did all the other
inhabitants of that peninsula.

Artabazus, therefore, laid siege to Potidaea; and having a
suspicion that the Olynthians were likely to revolt shortly, he
besieged their city also. Now Olynthus was at that time held by the
Bottiaeans, who had been driven from the parts about the Thermaic Gulf
by the Macedonians. Artabazus took the city, and, having so done,
led out all the inhabitants to a marsh in the neighbourhood, and there
slew them. After this he delivered the place into the hands of the
people called Chalcideans, having first appointed Critobulus of Torone
to be governor. Such was the way in which the Chalcideans got
Olynthus.

When this town had fallen, Artabazus pressed the siege of Potidaea
all the more unremittingly; and was pushing his operations with
vigour, when Timoxenus, captain of the Scionaeans, entered into a plot
to betray the town to him. How the matter was managed at first, I
cannot pretend to say, for no account has come down to us: but at
the last this is what happened. Whenever Timoxenus wished to send a
letter to Artabazus, or Artabazus to send one to Timoxenus, the letter
was written on a strip of paper, and rolled round the notched end of
an arrow-shaft; the feathers were then put on over the paper, and
the arrow thus prepared was shot to some place agreed upon. But
after a while the plot of Timoxenus to betray Potidaea was
discovered in this way. Artabazus, on one occasion, shot off his
arrow, intending to send it to the accustomed place, but, missing
his mark, hit one of the Potidaeans in the shoulder. A crowd
gathered about the wounded man, as commonly happens in war; and when
the arrow was pulled out, they noticed the paper, and straightway
carried it to the captains who were present from the various cities of
the peninsula. The captains read the letter, and, finding who the
traitor was, nevertheless resolved, out of regard for the city of
Scione, that as they did not wish the Scionaeans to be thenceforth
branded with the name of traitors, they would not bring against him
any charge of treachery. Such accordingly was the mode in which this
plot was discovered.

After Artabazus had continued the siege by the space of three
months, it happened that there was an unusual ebb of the tide, which
lasted a long while. So when the barbarians saw that what had been sea
was now no more than a swamp, they determined to push across it into
Pallene, And now the troops had already made good two-fifths of
their passage, and three-fifths still remained before they could reach
Palline, when the tide came in with a very high flood, higher than had
ever been seen before, as the inhabitants of those parts declare,
though high floods are by no means uncommon. All who were not able
to swim perished immediately; the rest were slain by the Potidaeans,
who bore down upon them in their sailing vessels. The Potidaeans say
that what caused this swell and flood, and so brought about the
disaster of the Persians which ensued therefrom, was the
profanation, by the very men now destroyed in the sea, of the temple
and image of Neptune, situated in their suburb. And in this they
seem to me to say well. Artabazus afterwards led away the remainder of
his army, and joined Mardonius in Thessaly. Thus fared it with the
Persians who escorted the king to the strait.

As for that part of the fleet of Xerxes which had survived the
battle, when it had made good its escape from Salamis to the coast
of Asia, and conveyed the king with his army across the strait from
the Chersonese to Abydos, it passed the winter at Cyme. On the first
approach of spring, there was an early muster of the ships at Samos,
where some of them indeed had remained throughout the winter. Most
of the men-at-arms who served on board were Persians, or else Medes;
and the command of the fleet had been taken by Mardontes, the son of
Bagaeus, and Artayntes, the son of Artachaeus; while there was
likewise a third commander, Ithamitres, the nephew of Artayntes,
whom his uncle had advanced to the post. Further west than Samos,
however, they did not venture to proceed; for they remembered what a
defeat they had suffered, and there was no one to compel them to
approach any nearer to Greece. They therefore remained at Samos, and
kept watch over Ionia, to hinder it from breaking into revolt. The
whole number of their ships, including those furnished by the Ionians,
was three hundred. It did not enter into their thoughts that the
Greeks would proceed against Ionia; on the contrary, they supposed
that the defence of their own country would content them, more
especially as they had not pursued the Persian fleet when it fled from
Salamis, but had so readily given up the chase. They despaired,
however, altogether of gaining any success by sea themselves, though
by land they thought that Mardonius was quite sure of victory. So they
remained at Samos, and took counsel together, if by any means they
might harass the enemy, at the same time that they waited eagerly to
hear how matters would proceed with Mardonius.

The approach of spring, and the knowledge that Mardonius was in
Thessaly, roused the Greeks from inaction. Their land force indeed was
not yet come together; but the fleet, consisting of one hundred and
ten ships, proceeded to Egina, under the command of Leotychides.
This Leotychides, who was both general and admiral, was the son of
Menares, the son of Agesilaus, the son of Hippocratides, the son of
Leotychides, the son of Anaxilaus, the son of Archidamus, the son of
Anaxandrides, the son of Theopompus, the son of Nicander, the son of
Charillus, the son of Eunomus, the son of Polydectes, the son of
Prytanis, the son of Euryphon, the son of Procles, the son of
Aristodemus, the son of Aristomachus, the son of Cleodaeus, the son of
Hyllus, the son of Hercules. He belonged to the younger branch of
the royal house. All his ancestors, except the two next in the above
list to himself, had been kings of Sparta. The Athenian vessels were
commanded by Xanthippus, the son of Ariphron.

When the whole fleet was collected together at Egina,
ambassadors from Ionia arrived at the Greek station; they had but just
come from paying a visit to Sparta, where they had been intreating the
Lacedaemonians to undertake the deliverance of their native land.
One of these ambassadors was Herodotus, the son of Basileides.
Originally they were seven in number; and the whole seven had
conspired to slay Strattis the tyrant of Chios; one, however, of those
engaged in the plot betrayed the enterprise; and the conspiracy
being in this way discovered, Herodotus, and the remaining five,
quitted Chios, and went straight to Sparta, whence they had now
proceeded to Egina, their object being to beseech the Greeks that they
would pass over to Ionia. It was not, however, without difficulty that
they were induced to advance even so far as Delos. All beyond that
seemed to the Greeks full of danger; the places were quite unknown
to them, and to their fancy swarmed with Persian troops; as for Samos,
it appeared to them as far off as the Pillars of Hercules. Thus it
came to pass, that at the very same time the barbarians were
hindered by their fears from venturing any further west than Samos,
and the prayers of the Chians failed to induce the Greeks to advance
any further east than Delos. Terror guarded the mid region.

The Greek fleet was now on its way to Delos; but Mardonius still
abode in his winter-quarters in Thessaly. When he was about to leave
them, he despatched a man named Mys, a European by birth, to go and
consult the different oracles, giving him orders to put questions
everywhere to all the oracles whereof he found it possible to make
trial. What it was that he wanted to know, when he gave Mys these
orders, I am not able to say, for no account has reached me of the
matter; but for my own part, I suppose that he sent to inquire
concerning the business which he had in hand, and not for any other
purpose.

Mys, it is certain, went to Lebadeia, and, by the payment of a sum
of money, induced one of the inhabitants to go down to Trophonius;
he likewise visited Abae of the Phocians, and there consulted the god;
while at Thebes, to which place he went first of all, he not only
got access to Apollo Ismenius (of whom inquiry is made by means of
victims, according to the custom practised also at Olympia), but
likewise prevailed on a man, who was not a Theban but a foreigner,
to pass the night in the temple of Amphiaraus. No Theban can
lawfully consult this oracle, for the following reason: Amphiaraus
by an oracle gave the Thebans their choice, to have him for their
prophet or for their helper in war; he bade them elect between the
two, and forego either one or the other; so they chose rather to
have him for their helper. On this account it is unlawful for a Theban
to sleep in his temple.

One thing which the Thebans declare to have happened at this
time is to me very surprising. Mys, the European, they say, after he
had gone about to all the oracles, came at last to the sacred precinct
of Apollo Ptous. The place itself bears the name of Ptoum; it is in
the country of the Thebans, and is situated on the mountain side
overlooking Lake Copais, only a very little way from the town called
Acraephia. Here Mys arrived, and entered the temple, followed by three
Theban citizens- picked men whom the state had appointed to take
down whatever answer the god might give. No sooner was he entered than
the prophet delivered him an oracle, but in a foreign tongue; so
that his Theban attendants were astonished, hearing a strange language
when they expected Greek, and did not know what to do. Mys, however,
the European, snatched from their hands the tablet which they had
brought with them, and wrote down what the prophet uttered. The reply,
he told them, was in the Carian dialect. After this, Mys departed
and returned to Thessaly.

Mardonius, when he had read the answers given by the oracles, sent
next an envoy to Athens. This was Alexander, the son of Amyntas, a
Macedonian, of whom he made choice for two reasons. Alexander was
connected with the Persians by family ties; for Gygaea, who was the
daughter of Amyntas, and sister to Alexander himself, was married to
Bubares, a Persian, and by him had a son, to wit, Amyntas of Asia; who
was named after his mother's father, and enjoyed the revenues of
Alabanda, a large city of Phrygia, which had been assigned him by
the king. Alexander was likewise (and of this too Mardonius was well
aware), both by services which he had rendered, and by formal
compact of friendship, connected with Athens. Mardonius therefore
thought that, by sending him, he would be most likely to gain over the
Athenians to the Persian side. He had heard that they were a
numerous and a warlike people, and he knew that the disasters which
had befallen the Persians by sea were mainly their work; he
therefore expected that, if he could form alliance with them, he would
easily get the mastery of the sea (as indeed he would have done,
beyond a doubt), while by land he believed that he was already greatly
superior; and so he thought by this alliance to make sure of
overcoming the Greeks. Perhaps, too, the oracles leant this way, and
counselled him to make Athens his friend: so that it may have been
in obedience to them that he sent the embassy.

This Alexander was descended in the seventh degree from Perdiccas,
who obtained the sovereignty over the Macedonians in the way which I
will now relate. Three brothers, descendants of Temenus, fled from
Argos to the Illyrians; their names were Gauanes, Aeropus, and
Perdiccas. From Illyria they went across to Upper Macedonia, where
they came to a certain town called Lebaea. There they hired themselves
out to serve the king in different employs; one tended the horses;
another looked after the cows; while Perdiccas, who was the
youngest, took charge of the smaller cattle. In those early times
poverty was not confined to the people: kings themselves were poor,
and so here it was the king's wife who cooked the victuals. Now,
whenever she baked the bread, she always observed that the loaf of the
labouring boy Perdiccas swelled to double its natural size. So the
queen, finding this never fail, spoke of it to her husband. Directly
that it came to his ears, the thought struck him that it was a
miracle, and boded something of no small moment. He therefore sent for
the three labourers, and told them to begone out of his dominions.
They answered, "they had a right to their wages; if he would pay
them what was due, they were quite willing to go." Now it happened
that the sun was shining down the chimney into the room where they
were; and the king, hearing them talk of wages, lost his wits, and
said, "There are the wages which you deserve; take that- I give it
you!" and pointed, as he spoke, to the sunshine. The two elder
brothers, Gauanes and Aeropus, stood aghast at the reply, and did
nothing; but the boy, who had a knife in his hand, made a mark with it
round the sunshine on the floor of the room, and said, "O king! we
accept your payment." Then he received the light of the sun three
times into his bosom, and so went away; and his brothers went with
him.

When they were gone, one of those who sat by told the king what
the youngest of the three had done, and hinted that he must have had
some meaning in accepting the wages given. Then the king, when he
heard what had happened, was angry, and sent horsemen after the youths
to slay them. Now there is a river in Macedonia to which the
descendants of these Argives offer sacrifice as their saviour. This
stream swelled so much, as soon as the sons of Temenus were safe
across, that the horsemen found it impossible to follow. So the
brothers escaped into another part of Macedonia, and took up their
abode near the place called "the Gardens of Midas, son of Gordias." In
these gardens there are roses which grow of themselves, so sweet
that no others can come near them, and with blossoms that have as many
as sixty petals apiece. It was here, according to the Macedonians,
that Silenus was made a prisoner. Above the gardens stands a
mountain called Bermius, which is so cold that none can reach the top.
Here the brothers made their abode; and from this place by, degrees
they conquered all Macedonia.

From the Perdiccas of whom we have here spoken, Alexander was
descended in the following way:- Alexander was the son of Amyntas,
Amyntas of Alcetas; the father of Alcetas was Aeropus; of Aeropus,
Philip; of Philip, Argaeus; of Argaeus, Perdiccas, the first
sovereign. Such was the descent of Alexander.

(SS 1.) When Alexander reached Athens as the ambassador of
Mardonius, he spoke as follows:-

"O men of Athens, these be the words of Mardonius. 'The king has
sent a message to me, saying, "All the trespasses which the
Athenians have committed against me I freely forgive. Now then,
Mardonius, thus shalt thou act towards them. Restore to them their
territory; and let them choose for themselves whatever land they
like besides, and let them dwell therein as a free people. Build up
likewise all their temples which I burned, if on these terms they will
consent to enter into a league with me." Such are the orders which I
have received, and which I must needs obey, unless there be a
hindrance on your part. And now I say unto you,- why are ye so mad
as to levy war against the king, whom ye cannot possibly overcome,
or even resist for ever? Ye have seen the multitude and the bravery of
the host of Xerxes; ye know also how large a power remains with me
in your land; suppose then ye should get the better of us, and
defeat this army- a thing whereof ye will not, if ye be wise,
entertain the least hope- what follows even then but a contest with
a still greater force? Do not, because you would fain match yourselves
with the king, consent to lose your country and live in constant
danger of your lives. Rather agree to make peace; which ye can now
do without any tarnish to your honour, since the king invites you to
it. Continue free, and make an alliance with us, without fraud or
deceit.'

(SS 2.) "These are the words, O Athenians! which Mardonius had bid
me speak to you. For my own part, I will say nothing of the good
will I bear your nation, since ye have not now for the first time to
become acquainted with it. But I will add my intreaties also, and
beseech you to give ear to Mardonius; for I see clearly that it is
impossible for you to go on for ever contending against Xerxes. If
that had appeared to me possible, I would not now have come hither the
bearer of such a message. But the king's power surpasses that of
man, and his arm reaches far. If then ye do not hasten to conclude a
peace, when such fair terms are offered you, I tremble to think of
what you will have to endure- you, who of all the allies lie most
directly in the path of danger, whose land will always be the chief
battleground of the contending powers, and who will therefore
constantly have to suffer alone. Hearken then, I pray you, to
Mardonius! Surely it is no small matter that the Great King chooses
you out from all the rest of the Greeks, to offer you forgiveness of
the wrongs you have done him, and to propose himself as your friend
and ally!"

Such were the words of Alexander. Now the Lacedaemonians, when
tidings reached them that Alexander was gone to Athens to bring
about a league between the Athenians and the barbarians, and when at
the same time they called to mind the prophecies which declared that
the Dorian race should one day be driven from the Peloponnese by the
Medes and the Athenians, were exceedingly afraid lest the Athenians
might consent to the alliance with Persia. They therefore lost no time
in sending envoys to Athens; and it so happened that these envoys were
given their audience at the same time with Alexander: for the
Athenians had waited and made delays, because they felt sure that
the Lacedaemonians would hear that an ambassador was come to them from
the Persians, and as soon as they heard it would with all speed send
an embassy. They contrived matters therefore of set purpose, so that
the Lacedaemonians might hear them deliver their sentiments on the
occasion.

As soon as Alexander had finished speaking, the ambassadors from
Sparta took the word and said,-

"We are sent here by the Lacedaemonians to entreat of you that
ye will not do a new thing in Greece, nor agree to the terms which are
offered you by the barbarian. Such conduct on the part of any of the
Greeks were alike unjust and dishonourable; but in you 'twould be
worse than in others, for divers reasons. 'Twas by you that this war
was kindled at the first among us- our wishes were in no way
considered; the contest began by your seeking to extend your empire-
now the fate of Greece is involved in it. Besides it was surely an
intolerable thing that the Athenians, who have always hitherto been
known as a nation to which many men owed their freedom, should now
become the means of bringing all other Greeks into slavery. We feel,
however, for the heavy calamities which press on you- the loss of your
harvest these two years, and the ruin in which your homes have lain
for so long a time. We offer you, therefore, on the part of the
Lacedaemonians and the allies, sustenance for your women and for the
unwarlike portion of your households, so long as the war endures. Be
ye not seduced by Alexander the Macedonian, who softens down the rough
words of Mardonius. He does as is natural for him to do- a tyrant
himself, he helps forward a tyrant's cause. But ye, Athenians,
should do differently, at least if ye be truly wise; for ye should
know that with barbarians there is neither faith nor truth."

Thus spake the envoys. After which the Athenians returned this
answer to Alexander:-

"We know, as well as thou dost, that the power of the Mede is many
times greater than our own: we did not need to have that cast in our
teeth. Nevertheless we cling so to freedom that we shall offer what
resistance we may. Seek not to persuade us into making terms with
the barbarian- say what thou wilt, thou wilt never gain our assent.
Return rather at once, and tell Mardonius that our answer to him is
this:- 'So long as the sun keeps his present course, we will never
join alliance with Xerxes. Nay, we shall oppose him unceasingly,
trusting in the aid of those gods and heroes whom he has lightly
esteemed, whose houses and whose images he has burnt with fire.'
come not thou again to us with words like these; nor, thinking to do
us a service, persuade us to unholy actions. Thou art the guest and
friend of our nation- we would not that thou shouldst receive hurt
at our hands."

Such was the answer which the Athenians gave to Alexander. To
the Spartan envoys they said:-

"'Twas natural no doubt that the Lacedaemonians should be afraid
we might make terms with the barbarian; but nevertheless It was a base
fear in men who knew so well of what temper and spirit we are. Not all
the gold that the whole earth contains- not the fairest and most
fertile of all lands- would bribe us to take part with the Medes and
help them to enslave our countrymen. Even could we anyhow have brought
ourselves to such a thing, there are many very powerful motives
which would now make it impossible. The first and chief of these is
the burning and destruction of our temples and the images of our gods,
which forces us to make no terms with their destroyer, but rather to
pursue him with our resentment to the uttermost. Again, there is our
common brotherhood with the Greeks: our common language, the altars
and the sacrifices of which we all partake, the common character which
we bear- did the Athenians betray all these, of a truth it would not
be well. Know then now, if ye have not known it before, that while one
Athenian remains alive, we will never join alliance with Xerxes. We
thank you, however, for your forethought on our behalf, and for your
wish to give our families sustenance, now that ruin has fallen on
us- the kindness is complete on your part; but for ourselves, we
will endure as we may, and not be burdensome to you. Such then is
our resolve. Be it your care with all speed to lead out your troops;
for if we surmise aright, the barbarian will not wait long ere he
invade our territory, but will set out so soon as he learns our answer
to be, that we will do none of those things which he requires of us.
Now then is the time for us, before he enters Attica, to go forth
ourselves into Boeotia, and give him battle."

When the Athenians had thus spoken, the ambassadors from Sparta
departed, and returned back to their own country.
