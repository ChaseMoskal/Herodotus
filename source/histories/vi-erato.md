ARISTAGORAS, the author of the Ionian revolt, perished in the
way which I have described. Meanwhile Histiaeus, tyrant of Miletus,
who had been allowed by Darius to leave Susa, came down to Sardis.
On his arrival, being asked by Artaphernes, the Sardian satrap, what
he thought was the reason that the Ionians had rebelled, he made
answer that he could not conceive, and it had astonished him
greatly, pretending to be quite unconscious of the whole business.
Artaphernes, however, who perceived that he was dealing dishonestly,
and who had in fact full knowledge of the whole history of the
outbreak, said to him, "I will tell thee how the case stands,
Histiaeus: this shoe is of thy stitching; Aristagoras has but put it
on."

Such was the remark made by Artaphernes concerning the
rebellion. Histiaeus, alarmed at the knowledge which he displayed,
so soon as night fell, fled away to the coast. Thus he forfeited his
word to Darius; for though he had pledged himself to bring Sardinia,
the biggest island in the whole world, under the Persian yoke, he in
reality sought to obtain the direction of the war against the king.
Crossing over to Chios, he was there laid in bonds by the inhabitants,
who accused him of intending some mischief against them in the
interest of Darius. However, when the whole truth was laid before
them, and they found that Histiaeus was in reality a foe to the
king, they forthwith set him at large again.

After this the Ionians inquired of him for what reason he had so
strongly urged Aristagoras to revolt from the king, thereby doing
their nation so ill a service. In reply, he took good care not to
disclose to them the real cause, but told them that King Darius had
intended to remove the Phoenicians from their own country, and place
them in Ionia, while he planted the Ionians in Phoenicia, and that
it was for this reason he sent Aristagoras the order. Now it was not
true that the king had entertained any such intention, but Histiaeus
succeeded hereby in arousing the fears of the Ionians.

After this, Histiaeus, by means of a certain Hermippus, a native
of Atarneus, sent letters to many of the Persians in Sardis, who had
before held some discourse with him concerning a revolt. Hermippus,
however, instead of conveying them to the persons to whom they were
addressed, delivered them into the hands of Artaphernes, who,
perceiving what was on foot, commanded Hermippus to deliver the
letters according to their addresses, and then bring him back the
answers which were sent to Histiaeus. The traitors being in this way
discovered, Artaphernes put a number of Persians to death, and
caused a commotion in Sardis.

As for Histiaeus, when his hopes in this matter were disappointed,
he persuaded the Chians to carry him back to Miletus; but the
Milesians were too well pleased at having got quit of Aristagoras to
be anxious to receive another tyrant into their country; besides which
they had now tasted liberty. They therefore opposed his return; and
when he endeavoured to force an entrance during the night, one of
the inhabitants even wounded him in the thigh. Having been thus
rejected from his country, he went back to Chios; whence, after
failing in an attempt to induce the Chians to give him ships, he
crossed over to Mytilene, where he succeeded in obtaining vessels from
the Lesbians. They fitted out a squadron of eight triremes, and sailed
with him to the Hellespont, where they took up their station, and
proceeded to seize all the vessels which passed out from the Euxine,
unless the crews declared themselves ready to obey his orders.

While Histiaeus and the Mytilenaeans were thus employed, Miletus
was expecting an attack from a vast armament, which comprised both a
fleet and also a land force. The Persian captains had drawn their
several detachments together, and formed them into a single army;
and had resolved to pass over all the other cities, which they
regarded as of lesser account, and to march straight on Miletus. Of
the naval states, Phoenicia showed the greatest zeal; but the fleet
was composed likewise of the Cyprians (who had so lately been
brought under), the Cilicians, and also the Egyptians.

While the Persians were thus making preparations against Miletus
and Ionia, the Ionians, informed of their intent, sent their
deputies to the Panionium, and held a council upon the posture of
their affairs. Hereat it was determined that no land force should be
collected to oppose the Persians, but that the Milesians should be
left to defend their own walls as they could; at the same time they
agreed that the whole naval force of the states, not excepting a
single ship, should be equipped, and should muster at Lade, a small
island lying off Miletus- to give battle on behalf of the place.

Presently the Ionians began to assemble in their ships, and with
them came the Aeolians of Lesbos; and in this way they marshalled
their line:- The wing towards the east was formed of the Milesians
themselves, who furnished eighty ships; next to them came the
Prienians with twelve, and the Myusians with three ships; after the
Myusians were stationed the Teians, whose ships were seventeen; then
the Chians, who furnished a hundred. The Erythraeans and Phocaeans
followed, the former with eight, the latter with three ships; beyond
the Phocaeans were the Lesbians, furnishing seventy; last of all
came the Samians, forming the western wing, and furnishing sixty
vessels. The fleet amounted in all to three hundred and fifty-three
triremes. Such was the number on the Ionian side.

On the side of the barbarians the number of vessels was six
hundred. These assembled off the coast of Milesia, while the land army
collected upon the shore; but the leaders, learning the strength of
the Ionian fleet, began to fear lest they might fail to defeat them,
in which case, not having the mastery at sea, they would be unable
to reduce Miletus, and might in consequence receive rough treatment at
the hands of Darius. So when they thought of all these things, they
resolved on the following course:- Calling together the Ionian
tyrants, who had fled to the Medes for refuge when Aristagoras deposed
them from their governments, and who were now in camp, having joined
in the expedition against Miletus, the Persians addressed them thus:
"Men of Ionia, now is the fit time to show your zeal for the house
of the king. Use your best efforts, every one of you, to detach your
fellow-countrymen from the general body. Hold forth to them the
promise that, if they submit, no harm shall happen to them on
account of their rebellion; their temples shall not be burnt, nor
any of their private buildings; neither shall they be treated with
greater harshness than before the outbreak. But if they refuse to
yield, and determine to try the chance of a battle, threaten them with
the fate which shall assuredly overtake them in that case. Tell
them, when they are vanquished in fight, they shall be enslaved; their
boys shall be made eunuchs, and their maidens transported to Bactra;
while their country shall be delivered into the hands of foreigners."

Thus spake the Persians. The Ionian tyrants sent accordingly by
night to their respective citizens, and reported the words of the
Persians; but the people were all staunch, and refused to betray their
countrymen, those of each state thinking that they alone had had
made to them. Now these events happened on the first appearance of the
Persians before Miletus.

Afterwards, while the Ionian fleet was still assembled at Lade,
councils were held, and speeches made by divers persons- among the
rest by Dionysius, the Phocaean captain, who thus expressed
himself:- "Our affairs hang on the razor's edge, men of Ionia,
either to be free or to be slaves; and slaves, too, who have shown
themselves runaways. Now then you have to choose whether you will
endure hardships, and so for the present lead a life of toil, but
thereby gain ability to overcome your enemies and establish your own
freedom; or whether you will persist in this slothfulness and
disorder, in which case I see no hope of your escaping the king's
vengeance for your rebellion. I beseech you, be persuaded by me, and
trust yourselves to my guidance. Then, if the gods only hold the
balance fairly between us, I undertake to say that our foes will
either decline a battle, or, if they fight, suffer complete
discomfiture."

These words prevailed with the Ionians, and forthwith they
committed themselves to Dionysius; whereupon he proceeded every day to
make the ships move in column, and the rowers ply their oars, and
exercise themselves in breaking the line; while the marines were
held under arms, and the vessels were kept, till evening fell, upon
their anchors, so that the men had nothing but toil from morning
even to night. Seven days did the Ionians continue obedient, and do
whatsoever he bade them; but on the eighth day, worn out by the
hardness of the work and the heat of the sun, and quite unaccustomed
to such fatigues, they began to confer together, and to say one to
another, "What god have we offended to bring upon ourselves such a
punishment as this? Fools and distracted that we were, to put
ourselves into the hands of this Phocaean braggart, who does but
furnish three ships to the fleet! He, now that he has got us,
plagues us in the most desperate fashion; many of us, in
consequence, have fallen sick already- many more expect to follow.
We had better suffer anything rather than these hardships; even the
slavery with which we are threatened, however harsh, can be no worse
than our present thraldom. Come, let us refuse him obedience." So
saying, they forthwith ceased to obey his orders, and pitched their
tents, as if they had been soldiers, upon the island, where they
reposed under the shade all day, and refused to go aboard the ships
and train themselves.

Now when the Samian captains perceived what was taking place, they
were more inclined than before to accept the terms which Aeaces, the
son of Syloson, had been authorised by the Persians to offer them,
on condition of their deserting from the confederacy. For they saw
that all was disorder among the Ionians, and they felt also that it
was hopeless to contend with the power of the king; since if they
defeated the fleet which had been sent against them, they knew that
another would come five times as great. So they took advantage of
the occasion which now offered, and as soon as ever they saw the
Ionians refuse to work, hastened gladly to provide for the safety of
their temples and their properties. This Aeaces, who made the
overtures to the Samians, was the son of Syloson, and grandson of
the earlier Aeaces. He had formerly been tyrant of Samos, but was
ousted from his government by Aristagoras the Milesian, at the same
time with the other tyrants of the Ionians.

The Phoenicians soon afterwards sailed to the attack; and the
Ionians likewise put themselves in line, and went out to meet them.
When they had now neared one another, and joined battle, which of
the Ionians fought like brave men and which like cowards, I cannot
declare with any certainty, for charges are brought on all sides;
but the tale goes that the Samians, according to the agreement which
they had made with Aeaces, hoisted sail, and quitting their post
bore away for Samos, except eleven ships, whose captains gave no
heed to the orders of the commanders, but remained and took part in
the battle. The state of Samos, in consideration of this action,
granted to these men, as an acknowledgment if their bravery, the
honour of having their names, and the names of their fathers,
inscribed upon a pillar, which still stands in the market-place. The
Lesbians also, when they saw the Samians, who were drawn up next them,
begin to flee, themselves did the like; and the example, once set, was
followed by the greater number of the Ionians.

Of those who remained and fought, none were so rudely handled as
the Chians, who displayed prodigies of valour, and disdained to play
the part of cowards. They furnished to the common fleet, as I
mentioned above, one hundred ships, having each of them forty armed
citizens, and those picked men, on board; and when they saw the
greater portion of the allies betraying the common cause, they for
their part, scorning to imitate the base conduct of these traitors,
although they were left almost alone and unsupported, a very few
friends continuing to stand by them, notwithstanding went on with
the fight, and ofttimes cut the line of the enemy, until at last,
after they had taken very many of their adversaries' ships, they ended
by losing more than half of their own. Hereupon, with the remainder of
their vessels, the Chians fled away to their own country.

As for such of their ships as were damaged and disabled, these,
being pursued by the enemy, made straight for Mycale, where the
crews ran them ashore, and abandoning them began their march along the
continent. Happening in their way upon the territory of Ephesus,
they essayed to cross it; but here a dire misfortune befell them. It
was night, and the Ephesian women chanced to be engaged in celebrating
the Thesmophoria- the previous calamity of the Chians had not been
heard of- so when the Ephesians saw their country invaded by an
armed band, they made no question of the new-comers being robbers
who purposed to carry off their women; and accordingly they marched
out against them in full force, and slew them all. Such were the
misfortunes which befell them of Chios.

Dionysius, the Phocaean, when he perceived that all was lost,
having first captured three ships from the enemy, himself took to
flight. He would not, however, return to Phocaea, which he well knew
must fall again, like the rest of Ionia, under the Persian yoke; but
straightway, as he was, he set sail for Phoenicia, and there sunk a
number of merchantmen, and gained a great booty; after which he
directed his course to Sicily, where he established himself as a
corsair, and plundered the Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians, but did no
harm to the Greeks.

The Persians, when they had vanquished the Ionians in the
sea-fight, besieged Miletus both by land and sea, driving mines
under the walls, and making use of every known device, until at length
they took both the citadel and the town, six years from the time
when the revolt first broke out under Aristagoras. All the inhabitants
of the city they reduced to slavery, and thus the event tallied with
the announcement which had been made by the oracle.

For once upon a time, when the Argives had sent to Delphi to
consult the god about the safety of their own city, a prophecy was
given them, in which others besides themselves were interested; for
while it bore in part upon the fortunes of Argos, it touched in a
by-clause the fate of the men of Miletus. I shall set down the portion
which concerned the Argives when I come to that part of my History,
mentioning at present only the passage in which the absent Milesians
were spoken of. This passage was as follows:-


Then shalt thou, Miletus, so oft the contriver of evil,

Be, thyself, to many a least and an excellent booty:

Then shall thy matrons wash the feet of long-haired masters-

Others shall then possess our lov'd Didymian temple.

Such a fate now befell the Milesians; for the Persians, who wore their
hair long, after killing most of the men, made the women and
children slaves; and the sanctuary at Didyma, the oracle no less
than the temple was plundered and burnt; of the riches whereof I
have made frequent mention in other parts of my History.

Those of the Milesians whose lives were spared, being carried
prisoners to Susa, received no ill treatment at the hands of King
Darius, but were established by him in Ampe, a city on the shores of
the Erythraean sea, near the spot where the Tigris flows into it.
Miletus itself, and the plain about the city, were kept by the
Persians for themselves, while the hill-country
was assigned to the Carians of Pedasus.

And now the Sybarites, who after the loss of their city occupied
Laus and Scidrus, failed duly to return the former kindness of the
Milesians. For these last, when Sybaris was taken by the Crotoniats,
made a great mourning, all of them, youths as well as men, shaving
their heads; since Miletus and Sybaris were, of all the cities whereof
we have any knowledge, the two most closely united to one another. The
Athenians, on the other hand, showed themselves beyond measure
afflicted at the fall of Miletus, in many ways expressing their
sympathy, and especially by their treatment of Phrynichus. For when
this poet brought out upon the stage his drama of the Capture of
Miletus, the whole theatre burst into tears; and the people
sentenced him to pay a fine of a thousand drachms, for recalling to
them their own misfortunes. They likewise made a law that no one
should ever again exhibit that piece.

Thus was Miletus bereft of its inhabitants. In Samos the people of
the richer sort were much displeased with the doings of the
captains, and the dealings they had had the Medes; they therefore held
a council, very shortly after the sea-fight, and resolved that they
would not remain to become the slaves of Aeaces and the Persians,
but before the tyrant set foot in their country, would sail away and
found a colony in another land. Now it chanced that about this time
the Zanclaeans of Sicily had sent ambassadors to the Ionians, and
invited them to Kale-Acte where they wished an Ionian city to be
founded. This place, Kale-Acte (or the Fair Strand) as it is called,
is in the country of the Sicilians, and is situated in the part of
Sicily which looks towards Tyrrhenia. The offer thus made to all the
Ionians was embraced only by the Samians, and by such of the Milesians
as had contrived to effect their escape.

Hereupon this is what ensued. The Samians on their voyage
reached the country of the Epizephyrian Locrians, at a time when the
Zanclaeans and their king Scythas were engaged in the siege of a
Sicilian town which they hoped to take. Anaxilaus, tyrant of
Rhegium, who was on ill terms with the Zanclaeans knowing how
matters stood, made application to the Samians, and persuaded them
to give up the thought of Kale-Acte the place to which they were
bound, and to seize Zancle itself, which was left without men. The
Samians followed this counsel and possessed themselves of the town;
which the Zanclaeans no sooner heard than they hurried to the
rescue, calling to their aid Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, who was
one of their allies. Hippocrates came with his army to their
assistance; but on his arrival he seized Scythas, the Zanclaean
king, who had just lost his city, and sent him away in chains,
together with his brother Pythogenes, to the town of Inycus; after
which he came to an understanding with the Samians, exchanged oaths
with them, and agreed to betray the people of Zancle. The reward of
his treachery was to be one-half of the goods and chattels,
including slaves, which the town contained, and all that he could find
in the open country. Upon this Hippocrates seized and bound the
greater number of the Zanclaeans as slaves; delivering, however,
into the hands of the Samians three hundred of the principal citizens,
to be slaughtered; but the Samians spared the lives of these persons.

Scythas, the king of the Zanclaeans, made his escape from
Inycus, and fled to Himera; whence he passed into Asia, and went up to
the court of Darius. Darius thought him the most upright of all the
Greeks to whom he afforded a refuge; for with the king's leave he paid
a visit to Sicily, and thence returned back to Persia, where he
lived in great comfort, and died by a natural death at an advanced
age.

Thus did the Samians escape the yoke of the Medes, and possess
themselves without any trouble of Zancle, a most beautiful city. At
Samos itself the Phoenicians, after the fight which had Miletus for
its prize was over, re-established Aeaces, the son of Syloson, upon
his throne. This they did by the command of the Persians, who looked
upon Aeaces as one who had rendered them a high service and
therefore deserved well at their hands. They likewise spared the
Samians, on account of the desertion of their vessels, and did not
burn either their city or their temples, as they did those of the
other rebels. Immediately after the fall of Miletus the Persians
recovered Caria, bringing some of the cities over by force, while
others submitted of their own accord.

Meanwhile tidings of what had befallen Miletus reached Histiaeus
the Milesian, who was still at Byzantium, employed in intercepting the
Ionian merchantmen as they issued from the Euxine. Histiaeus had no
sooner heard the news than he gave the Hellespont in charge to
Bisaltes, son of Apollophanes, a native of Abydos, and himself, at the
head of his Lesbians, set sail for Chios. One of the Chian garrisons
which opposed him he engaged at a place called "The Hollows," situated
in the Chian territory, and of these he slaughtered a vast number;
afterwards, by the help of his Lesbians, he reduced all the rest of
the Chians, who were weakened by their losses in the sea-fight,
Polichne, a city of Chios, serving him as head-quarters.

It mostly happens that there is some warning when great
misfortunes are about to befall a state or nation; and so it was in
this instance, for the Chians had previously had some strange tokens
sent to them. A choir of a hundred of their youths had been despatched
to Delphi; and of these only two had returned; the remaining
ninety-eight having been carried off by a pestilence. Likewise,
about the same time, and very shortly before the sea-fight, the roof
of a school-house had fallen in upon a number of their boys, who
were at lessons; and out of a hundred and twenty children there was
but one left alive. Such were the signs which God sent to warn them.
It was very shortly afterwards that the sea-fight happened, which
brought the city down upon its knees; and after the sea-fight came the
attack of Histiaeus and his Lesbians, to whom the Chians, weakened
as they were, furnished an easy conquest.

Histiaeus now led a numerous army, composed of Ionians and
Aelians, against Thasos, and had laid siege to the place when news
arrived that the Phoenicians were about to quit Miletus and attack the
other cities of Ionia. On hearing this, Histiaeus raised the siege
of Thasos, and hastened to Lesbos with all his forces. There his
army was in great straits for want of food; whereupon Histiaeus left
Lesbos and went across to the mainland, intending to cut the crops
which were growing in the Atarnean territory, and likewise in the
plain of the Caicus, which belonged to Mysia. Now it chanced that a
certain Persian named Harpagus was in these regions at the head of
an army of no little strength. He, when Histiaeus landed, marched
out to meet him, and engaging with his forces destroyed the greater
number of them, and took Histiaeus himself prisoner.

Histiaeus fell into the hands of the Persians in the following
manner. The Greeks and Persians engaged at Malena, in the region of
Atarneus; and the battle was for a long time stoutly contested, till
at length the cavalry came up, and, charging the Greeks, decided the
conflict. The Greeks fled; and Histiaeus, who thought that Darius
would not punish his fault with death, showed how he loved his life by
the following conduct. Overtaken in his flight by one of the Persians,
who was about to run him through, he cried aloud in the Persian tongue
that he was Histiaeus the Milesian.

Now, had he been taken straightway before King Darius, I verily
believe that he would have received no hurt, but the king would have
freely forgiven him. Artaphernes, however, satrap of Sardis, and his
captor Harpagus, on this very account- because they were afraid
that, if he escaped, he would be again received into high favour by
the king- put him to death as soon as he arrived at Sardis. His body
they impaled at that place, while they embalmed his head and sent it
up to Susa to the king. Darius, when he learnt what had taken place,
found great fault with the men engaged in this business for not
bringing Histiaeus alive into his presence, and commanded his servants
to wash and dress the head with all care, and then bury it, as the
head of a man who had been a great benefactor to himself and the
Persians. Such was the sequel of the history of Histiaeus.

The naval armament of the Persians wintered at Miletus, and in the
following year proceeded to attack the islands off the coast, Chios,
Lesbos, and Tenedos, which were reduced without difficulty. Whenever
they became masters of an island, the barbarians, in every single
instance, netted the inhabitants. Now the mode in which they
practise this netting is the following. Men join hands, so as to
form a line across from the north coast to the south, and then march
through the island from end to end and hunt out the inhabitants. In
like manner the Persians took also the Ionian towns upon the mainland,
not however netting the inhabitants, as it was not possible.

And now their generals made good all the threats wherewith they
had menaced the Ionians before the battle. For no sooner did they
get possession of the towns than they choose out all the best favoured
boys and made them eunuchs, while the most beautiful of the girls they
tore from their homes and sent as presents to the king, at the same
time burning the cities themselves, with their temples. Thus were
the Ionians for the third time reduced to slavery; once by the
Lydians, and a second, and now a third time, by the Persians.

The sea force, after quitting Ionia, proceeded to the
Hellespont, and took all the towns which lie on the left shore as
one sails into the straits. For the cities on the right bank had
already been reduced by the land force of the Persians. Now these
are the places which border the Hellespont on the European side; the
Chersonese, which contains a number of cities, Perinthus, the forts in
Thrace, Selybria, and Byzantium. The Byzantines at this time, and
their opposite neighbours, the Chalcedonians, instead of awaiting
the coming of the Phoenicians, quitted their country, and sailing into
the Euxine, took up their abode at the city of Mesembria. The
Phoenicians, after burning all the places above mentioned, proceeded
to Proconnresus and Artaca, which they likewise delivered to the
flames; this done, they returned to the Chersonese, being minded to
reduce those cities which they had not ravaged in their former cruise.
Upon Cyzicus they made no attack at all, as before their coming the
inhabitants had made terms with Oebares, the son of Megabazus, and
satrap of Dascyleium, and had submitted themselves to the king. In the
Chersonese the Phoenicians subdued all the cities, excepting Cardia.

Up to this time the cities of the Chersonese had been under the
government of Miltiades, the son of Cimon, and grandson of Stesagoras,
to whom they had descended from Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, who
obtained possession of them in the following manner. The Dolonci, a
Thracian tribe, to whom the Chersonese at that time belonged, being
harassed by a war in which they were engaged with the Apsinthians,
sent their princes to Delphi to consult the oracle about the matter.
The reply of the Pythoness bade them "take back with them as a
colonist into their country the man who should first offer them
hospitality after they quitted the temple." The Dolonci, following the
Sacred Road, passed through the regions of Phocis and Boeotia; after
which, as still no one invited them in, they turned aside, and
travelled to Athens.

Now Pisistratus was at this time sole lord of Athens; but
Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, was likewise a person of much
distinction. He belonged to a family which was wont to contend in
the four-horse-chariot races, and traced its descent to Aeacus and
Egina, but which, from the time of Philaeas, the son of Ajax, who
was the first Athenian citizen of the house, had been naturalised at
Athens. It happened that as the Dolonci passed his door Miltiades
was sitting in his vestibule, which caused him to remark them, dressed
as they were in outlandish garments, and armed moreover with lances.
He therefore called to them, and, on their approach, invited them
in, offering them lodging and entertainment. The strangers accepted
his hospitality, and, after the banquet was over, they laid before him
in full the directions of the oracle and besought him on their own
part to yield obedience to the god. Miltiades was persuaded ere they
had done speaking; for the government of Pisistratus was irksome to
him, and he wanted to be beyond the tyrant's reach. He therefore
went straightway to Delphi, and inquired of the oracle whether he
should do as the Dolonci desired.

As the Pythoness backed their request, Miltiades, son of
Cypselus who had already won the four-horse chariot-race at Olympia,
left Athens, taking with him as many of the Athenians as liked to join
in the enterprise, and sailed away with the Dolonci. On his arrival at
the Chersonese, he was made king by those who had invited him. After
this his first act was to build a wall across the neck of the
Chersonese from the city of Cardia to Pactya, to protect the country
from the incursions and ravages of the Apsinthians. The breadth of the
isthmus at this part is thirty-six furlongs, the whole length of the
peninsula within the isthmus being four hundred and twenty furlongs.

When he had finished carrying the wall across the isthmus, and had
thus secured the Chersonese against the Apsinthians, Miltiades
proceeded to engage in other wars, and first of all attacked the
Lampsacenians; but falling into an ambush which they had laid he had
the misfortune to be taken prisoner. Now it happened that Miltiades
stood high in the favour of Croesus, king of Lydia. When Croesus
therefore heard of his calamity, he sent and commanded the men of
Lampsacus to give Miltiades his freedom; "if they refused," he said,
"he would destroy them like a fir." Then the Lampsacenians were
somewhile in doubt about this speech of Croesus, and could not tell
how to construe his threat "that he would destroy them like a fir";
but at last one of their elders divined the true sense, and told
them that the fir is the only tree which, when cut down, makes no
fresh shoots, but forthwith dies outright. So the Lampsacenians, being
greatly afraid of Croesus, released Miltiades, and let him go free.

Thus did Miltiades, by the help of Croesus, escape this danger.
Some time afterwards he died childless, leaving his kingdom and his
riches to Stesagoras, who was the son of Cimon, his half-brother. Ever
since his death the people of the Chersonese have offered him the
customary sacrifices of a founder; and they have further established
in his honour a gymnic contest and a chariot-race, in neither of which
is it lawful for any Lampsacenian to contend. Before the war with
Lampsacus was ended Stesagoras too died childless: he was sitting in
the hall of justice when he was struck upon the head with a hatchet by
a man who pretended to be a deserter, but was in good sooth an
enemy, and a bitter one.

Thus died Stesagoras; and upon his death the Pisistratidae
fitted out a trireme, and sent Miltiades, the son of Cimon, and
brother of the deceased, to the Chersonese, that he might undertake
the management of affairs in that quarter. They had already shown
him much favour at Athens, as if, forsooth, they had been no parties
to the death of his father Cimon- a matter whereof I will give an
account in another place. He upon his arrival remained shut up
within the house, pretending to do honour to the memory of his dead
brother; whereupon the chief people of the Chersonese gathered
themselves together from all the cities of the land, and came in a
procession to the place where Miltiades was, to condole with him
upon his misfortune. Miltiades commanded them to be seized and
thrown into prison; after which he made himself master of the
Chersonese, maintained a body of five hundred mercenaries, and married
Hegesipyla, daughter of the Thracian king Olorus.

This Miltiades, the son of Cimon, had not been long in the country
when a calamity befell him yet more grievous than those in which he
was now involved: for three years earlier he had had to fly before
an incursion of the Scyths. These nomads, angered by the attack of
Darius, collected in a body and marched as far as the Chersonese.
Miltiades did not await their coming, but fled, and remained away
until the Scyths retired, when the Dolonci sent and fetched him
back. All this happened three years before the events which befell
Miltiades at the present time.

He now no sooner heard that the Phoenicians were attacking Tenedos
than he loaded five triremes with his goods and chattels, and set sail
for Athens. Cardia was the point from which he took his departure; and
as he sailed down the gulf of Melas, along the shore of the
Chersonese, he came suddenly upon the whole Phoenician fleet.
However he himself escaped, with four of his vessels, and got into
Imbrus, one trireme only falling into the hands of his pursuers.
This vessel was under the command of his eldest son Metiochus, whose
mother was not the daughter of the Thracian king Olorus, but a
different woman. Metiochus and his ship were taken; and when the
Phoenicians found out that he was a son of Miltiades they resolved
to convey him to the king, expecting thereby to rise high in the royal
favour. For they remembered that it was Miltiades who counselled the
Ionians to hearken when the Scyths prayed them to break up the
bridge and return home. Darius, however, when the Phoenicians
brought Metiochus into his presence, was so far from doing him any
hurt, that he loaded him with benefits. He gave him a house and
estate, and also a Persian wife, by whom there were children born to
him who were accounted Persians. As for Miltiades himself, from Imbrus
he made his way in safety to Athens.

At this time the Persians did no more hurt to the Ionians; but
on the contrary, before the year was out, they carried into effect the
following measures, which were greatly to their advantage.
Artaphernes, satrap of Sardis, summoned deputies from all the Ionian
cities, and forced them to enter into agreements with one another, not
to harass each other by force of arms, but to settle their disputes by
reference. He likewise took the measurement of their whole country
in parasangs- such is the name which the Persians give to a distance
of thirty furlongs- and settled the tributes which the several
cities were to pay, at a rate that has continued unaltered from the
time when Artaphernes fixed it down to the present day. The rate was
very nearly the same as that which had been paid before the revolt.
Such were the peaceful dealings of the Persians with the Ionians.

The next spring Darius superseded all the other generals, and sent
down Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, to the coast, and with him a
vast body of men, some fit for sea, others for land service. Mardonius
was a youth at this time, and had only lately married Artazostra,
the king's daughter. When Mardonius, accompanied by this numerous
host, reached Cilicia, he took ship and proceeded along shore with his
fleet, while the land army marched under other leaders towards the
Hellespont. In the course of his voyage along the coast of Asia he
came to Ionia; and here I have a marvel to relate which will greatly
surprise those Greeks who cannot believe that Otanes advised the seven
conspirators to make Persia a commonwealth. Mardonius put down all the
despots throughout Ionia, and in lieu of them established democracies.
Having so done, he hastened to the Hellespont, and when a vast
multitude of ships had been brought together, and likewise a
powerful land force, he conveyed his troops across the strait by means
of his vessels, and proceeded through Europe against Eretria and
Athens.

At least these towns served as a pretext for the expedition, the
real purpose of which was to subjugate as great a number as possible
of the Grecian cities; and this became plain when the Thasians, who
did not even lift a hand in their defence, were reduced by the sea
force, while the land army added the Macedonians to the former
slaves of the king. All the tribes on the hither side of Macedonia had
been reduced previously. From Thasos the fleet stood across to the
mainland, and sailed along shore to Acanthus, whence an attempt was
made to double Mount Athos. But here a violent north wind sprang up,
against which nothing could contend, and handled a large number of the
ships with much rudeness, shattering them and driving them aground
upon Athos. 'Tis said the number of the ships destroyed was little
short of three hundred; and the men who perished were more than twenty
thousand. For the sea about Athos abounds in monsters beyond all
others; and so a portion were seized and devoured by these animals,
while others were dashed violently against the rocks; some, who did
not know how to swim, were engulfed; and some died of the cold.

While thus it fared with the fleet, on land Mardonius and his army
were attacked in their camp during the night by the Brygi, a tribe
of Thracians; and here vast numbers of the Persians were slain, and
even Mardonius himself received a wound. The Brygi, nevertheless,
did not succeed in maintaining their own freedom: for Mardonius
would not leave the country till he had subdued them and made them
subjects of Persia. Still, though he brought them under the yoke,
the blow which his land force had received at their hands, and the
great damage done to his fleet off Athos, induced him to set out
upon his retreat; and so this armament, having failed disgracefully,
returned to Asia.

The year after these events, Darius received information from
certain neighbours of the Thasians that those islanders were making
preparations for revolt; he therefore sent a herald, and bade them
dismantle their walls, and bring all their ships to Abdera. The
Thasians, at the time when Histiaeus the Milesian made his attack upon
them, had resolved that, as their income was very great, they would
apply their wealth to building ships of war, and surrounding their
city with another and a stronger wall. Their revenue was derived
partly from their possessions upon the mainland, partly from the mines
which they owned. They were masters of the gold mines at
Scapte-Hyle, the yearly produce of which amounted in all to eighty
talents. Their mines in Thasos yielded less, but still were so far
prolific that, besides being entirely free from land-tax, they had a
surplus income, derived from the two sources of their territory on the
main and their mines, in common years of two hundred, and in the
best years of three hundred talents.

I myself have seen the mines in question: by far the most
curious of them are those which the Phoenicians discovered at the time
when they went with Thasus and colonised the island, which
afterwards took its name from him. These Phoenician workings are in
Thasos itself, between Coenyra and a place called Aenyra, over against
Samothrace: a huge mountain has been turned upside down in the
search for ores. Such then was the source of their wealth. On this
occasion no sooner did the Great King issue his commands than
straightway the Thasians dismantled their wall, and took their whole
fleet to Abdera.

After this Darius resolved to prove the Greeks, and try the bent
of their minds, whether they were inclined to resist him in arms or
prepared to make their submission. He therefore sent out heralds in
divers directions round about Greece, with orders to demand everywhere
earth and water for the king. At the same time he sent other heralds
to the various seaport towns which paid him tribute, and required them
to provide a number of ships of war and horse-transports.

These towns accordingly began their preparations; and the
heralds who had been sent into Greece obtained what the king had bid
them ask from a large number of the states upon the mainland, and
likewise from all the islanders whom they visited. Among these last
were included the Eginetans, who, equally with the rest, consented
to give earth and water to the Persian king.

When the Athenians heard what the Eginetans had done, believing
that it was from enmity to themselves that they had given consent, and
that the Eginetans intended to join the Persian in his attack upon
Athens, they straightway took the matter in hand. In good truth it
greatly rejoiced them to have so fair a pretext; and accordingly
they sent frequent embassies to Sparta, and made it a charge against
the Eginetans that their conduct in this matter proved them to be
traitors to Greece.

Hereupon Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandridas, who was then king
of the Spartans, went in person to Egina, intending to seize those
whose guilt was the greatest. As soon however as he tried to arrest
them, a number of the Eginetins made resistance; a certain Crius,
son of Polycritus, being the foremost in violence. This person told
him "he should not carry off a single Eginetan without it costing
him dear- the Athenians had bribed him to make this attack, for
which he had no warrant from his own government- otherwise both the
kings would have come together to make the seizure." This he said in
consequence of instructions which he had received from Demaratus.
Hereupon Cleomenes, finding that he must quit Egina, asked Crius his
name; and when Crius told him, "Get thy horns tipped with brass with
all speed, O Crius!" he said, "for thou wilt have to struggle with a
great danger."

Meanwhile Demaratus, son of Ariston, was bringing charges
against Cleomenes at Sparta. He too, like Cleomenes, was king of the
Spartans, but he belonged to the lower house- not indeed that his
house was of any lower origin than the other, for both houses are of
one blood- but the house of Eurysthenes is the more honoured of the
two, inasmuch as it is the elder branch.

The Lacedaemonians declare, contradicting therein all the poets,
that it was king Aristodemus himself, son of Aristomachus, grandson of
Cleodaeus, and great-grandson of Hyllus, who conducted them to the
land which they now possess, and not the sons of Aristodemus. The wife
of Aristodemus, whose name (they say) was Argeia, and who was daughter
of Autesion, son of Tisamenus, grandson of Thersander, and
great-grandson of Polynices, within a little while after their
coming into the country, gave birth to twins. Aristodemus just lived
to see his children, but died soon afterwards of a disease. The
Lacedaemonians of that day determined, according to custom, to take
for their king the elder of the two children; but they were so
alike, and so exactly of one size, that they could not possibly tell
which of the two to choose: so when they found themselves unable to
make a choice, or haply even earlier, they went to the mother and
asked her to tell them which was the elder, whereupon she declared
that "she herself did not know the children apart"; although in good
truth she knew them very well, and only feigned ignorance in order
that, if it were possible, both of them might be made kings of Sparta.
The Lacedaemonians were now in a great strait; so they sent to
Delphi and inquired of the oracle how they should deal with the
matter. The Pythoness made answer, "Let both be taken to be kings; but
let the elder have the greater honour." So the Lacedaemonians were
in as great a strait as before, and could not conceive how they were
to discover which was the first-born, till at length a certain
Messenian, by name Panites, suggested to them to watch and see which
of the two the mother washed and fed first; if they found she always
gave one the preference, that fact would tell them all they wanted
to know; if, on the contrary, she herself varied, and sometimes took
the one first, sometimes the other, it would be plain that she knew as
little as they; in which case they must try some other plan. The
Lacedaemonians did according to the advice of the Messenian, and,
without letting her know why, kept a watch upon the mother; by which
means they discovered that, whenever she either washed or fed her
children, she always gave the same child the preference. So they
took the boy whom the mother honoured the most, and regarding him as
the first-born, brought him up in the palace; and the name which
they gave to the elder boy was Eurysthenes, while his brother they
called Procles. When the brothers grew up, there was always, so long
as they lived, enmity between them; and the houses sprung from their
loins have continued the feud to this day.

Thus much is related by the Lacedaemonians, but not by any of
the other Greeks; in what follows I give the tradition of the Greeks
generally. The kings of the Dorians (they say)- counting up to
Perseus, son of Danae, and so omitting the god- are rightly given in
the common Greek lists, and rightly considered to have been Greeks
themselves; for even at this early time they ranked among that people.
I say "up to Perseus," and not further, because Perseus has no
mortal father by whose name he is called, as Hercules has in
Amphitryon; whereby it appears that I have reason on my side, and am
right in saying, "up to Perseus." If we follow the line of Danad,
daughter of Acrisius, and trace her progenitors, we shall find that
the chiefs of the Dorians are really genuine Egyptians. In the
genealogies here given I have followed the common Greek accounts.

According to the Persian story, Perseus was an Assyrian who became
a Greek; his ancestors, therefore, according to them, were not Greeks.
They do not admit that the forefathers of Acrisius were in any way
related to Perseus, but say they were Egyptians, as the Greeks
likewise testify.

Enough however of this subject. How it came to pass that Egyptians
obtained the kingdoms of the Dorians, and what they did to raise
themselves to such a position, these are questions concerning which,
as they have been treated by others, I shall say nothing. I proceed to
speak of points on which no other writer has touched.

The prerogatives which the Spartans have allowed their kings are
the following. In the first place, two priesthoods, those (namely)
of Lacedaemonian and of Celestial Jupiter; also the right of making
war on what country soever they please, without hindrance from any
of the other Spartans, under pain of outlawry; on service the
privilege of marching first in the advance and last in the retreat,
and of having a hundred picked men for their body guard while with the
army; likewise the liberty of sacrificing as many cattle in their
expeditions as it seems them good, and the right of having the skins
and the chines of the slaughtered animals for their own use.

Such are their privileges in war; in peace their rights are as
follows. When a citizen makes a public sacrifice the kings are given
the first seats at the banquet; they are served before any of the
other guests, and have a double portion of everything; they take the
lead in the libations; and the hides of the sacrificed beasts belong
to them. Every month, on the first day, and again on the seventh of
the first decade, each king receives a beast without blemish at the
public cost, which he offers up to Apollo; likewise a medimnus of
meal, and of wine a Laconian quart. In the contests of the Games
they have always the seat of honour; they appoint the citizens who
have to entertain foreigners; they also nominate, each of them, two of
the Pythians, officers whose business it is to consult the oracle at
Delphi, who eat with the kings, and, like them, live at the public
charge. If the kings do not come to the public supper, each of them
must have two choenixes of meal and a cotyle of wine sent home to
him at his house; if they come, they are given a double quantity of
each, and the same when any private man invites them to his table.
They have the custody of all the oracles which are pronounced; but the
Pythians must likewise have knowledge of them. They have the whole
decision of certain causes, which are these, and these only:- When a
maiden is left the heiress of her father's estate, and has not been
betrothed by him to any one, they decide who is to marry her; in all
matters concerning the public highways they judge; and if a person
wants to adopt a child, he must do it before the kings. They
likewise have the right of sitting in council with the
eight-and-twenty senators; and if they are not present, then the
senators nearest of kin to them have their privileges, and give two
votes as the royal proxies, besides a third vote, which is their own.

Such are the honours which the Spartan people have allowed their
kings during their lifetime; after they are dead other honours await
them. Horsemen carry the news of their death through all Laconia,
while in the city the women go hither and thither drumming upon a
kettle. At this signal, in every house two free persons, a man and a
woman, must put on mourning, or else be subject to a heavy fine. The
Lacedaemonians have likewise a custom at the demise of their kings
which is common to them with the barbarians of Asia- indeed with the
greater number of the barbarians everywhere- namely, that when one
of their kings dies, not only the Spartans, but a certain number of
the country people from every part of Laconia are forced, whether they
will or no, to attend the funeral. So these persons and the helots,
and likewise the Spartans themselves, flock together to the number
of several thousands, men and women intermingled; and all of them
smite their foreheads violently, and weep and wall without stint,
saying always that their last king was the best. If a king dies in
battle, then they make a statue of him, and placing it upon a couch
right bravely decked, so carry it to the grave. After the burial, by
the space of ten days there is no assembly, nor do they elect
magistrates, but continue mourning the whole time.

They hold with the Persians also in another custom. When a king
dies, and another comes to the throne, the newly-made monarch forgives
all the Spartans the debts which they owe either to the king or to the
public treasury. And in like manner among the Persians each king
when he begins to reign remits the tribute due from the provinces.

In one respect the Lacedaemonians resemble the Egyptians. Their
heralds and flute-players, and likewise their cooks, take their trades
by succession from their fathers. A flute-player must be the son of
a flute-player, a cook of a cook, a herald of a herald; and other
people cannot take advantage of the loudness of their voice to come
into the profession and shut out the heralds' sons; but each follows
his father's business. Such are the customs of the Lacedaemonians.

At the time of which we are speaking, while Cleomenes in Egina was
labouring for the general good of Greece, Demaratus at Sparta
continued to bring charges against him, moved not so much by love of
the Eginetans as by jealousy and hatred of his colleague. Cleomenes
therefore was no sooner returned from Egina than he considered with
himself how he might deprive Demaratus of his kingly office; and
here the following circumstance furnished a ground for him to
proceed upon. Ariston, king of Sparta, had been married to two
wives, but neither of them had borne him any children; as however he
still thought it was possible he might have offspring, he resolved
to wed a third; and this was how the wedding was brought about. He had
a certain friend, a Spartan, with whom he was more intimate than
with any other citizen. This friend was married to a wife whose beauty
far surpassed that of all the other women in Sparta; and what was
still more strange, she had once been as ugly as she now was
beautiful. For her nurse, seeing how ill-favoured she was, and how
sadly her parents, who were wealthy people, took her bad looks to
heart, bethought herself of a plan, which was to carry the child every
day to the temple of Helen at Therapna, which stands above the
Phoebeum, and there to place her before the image, and beseech the
goddess to take away the child's ugliness. One day, as she left the
temple, a woman appeared to her, and begged to know what it was she
held in her arms. The nurse told her it was a child, on which she
asked to see it; but the nurse refused; the parents, she said, had
forbidden her to show the child to any one. However the woman would
not take a denial; and the nurse, seeing how highly she prized a look,
at last let her see the child. Then the woman gently stroked its head,
and said, "One day this child shall be the fairest dame in Sparta."
And her looks began to change from that very day. When she was of
marriageable age, Agetus, son of Alcides, the same whom I have
mentioned above as the friend of Ariston, made her his wife.

Now it chanced that Ariston fell in love with this person; and his
love so preyed upon his mind that at last he devised as follows. He
went to his friend, the lady's husband, and proposed to him that
they should exchange gifts, each taking that which pleased him best
out of all the possessions of the other. His friend, who felt no alarm
about his wife, since Ariston was also married, consented readily; and
so the matter was confirmed between them by an oath. Then Ariston gave
Agetus the present, whatever it was, of which he had made choice,
and when it came to his turn to name the present which he was to
receive in exchange, required to be allowed to carry home with him
Agetus's wife. But the other demurred, and said, "except his wife,
he might have anything else": however, as he could not resist the oath
which he had sworn, or the trickery which had been practised on him,
at last he suffered Ariston to carry her away to his house.

Ariston hereupon put away his second wife and took for his third
this woman; and she, in less than the due time- when she had not yet
reached her full term of ten months- gave birth to a child, the
Demaratus of whom we have spoken. Then one of his servants came and
told him the news, as he sat in council with the Ephors; whereat,
remembering when it was that the woman became his wife, he counted the
months upon his fingers, and having so done, cried out with an oath,
"The boy cannot be mine." This was said in the hearing of the
Ephors; but they made no account of it at the time. The boy grew up;
and Ariston repented of what he had said; for he became altogether
convinced that Demaratus was truly his son. The reason why he named
him Demaratus was the following. Some time before these events the
whole Spartan people, looking upon Ariston as a man of mark beyond all
the kings that had reigned at Sparta before him, had offered up a
prayer that he might have a son. On this account, therefore, the
name Demaratus was given.

In course of time Ariston died; and Demaratus received the
kingdom: but it was fated, as it seems, that these words, when bruited
abroad, should strip him of his sovereignty. This was brought about by
means of Cleomenes, whom he had twice sorely vexed, once when he led
the army home from Eleusis, and a second time when Cleomenes was
gone across to Egina against such as had espoused the side of the
Medes.

Cleomenes now, being resolved to have his revenge upon
Demaratus, went to Leotychides, the son of Menares, and grandson of
Agis, who was of the same family as Demaratus, and made agreement with
him to this tenor following. Cleomenes was to lend his aid to make
Leotychides king in the room of Demaratus; and then Leotychides was to
take part with Cleomenes against the Eginetans. Now Leotychides
hated Demaratus chiefly on account of Percalus, the daughter of
Chilon, son of Demarmenus: this lady had been betrothed to
Leotychides; but Demaratus laid a plot, and robbed him of his bride,
forestalling him in carrying her off, and marrying her. Such was the
origin of the enmity. At the time of which we speak, Leotychides was
prevailed upon by the earnest desire of Cleomenes to come forward
against Demaratus and make oath "that Demaratus was not rightful
king of Sparta, since he was not the true son of Ariston." After he
had thus sworn, Leotychides sued Demaratus, and brought up against him
the phrase which Ariston had let drop when, on the coming of his
servant to announce to him the birth of his son, he counted the
months, and cried out with an oath that the child was not his. It
was on this speech of Ariston's that Leotychides relied to prove
that Demaratus was not his son, and therefore not rightful king of
Sparta; and he produced as witnesses the Ephors who were sitting
with Ariston at the time and heard what he said.

At last, as there came to be much strife concerning this matter,
the Spartans made a decree that the Delphic oracle should be asked
to say whether Demaratus were Ariston's son or no. Cleomenes set
them upon this plan; and no sooner was the decree passed than he
made a friend of Cobon, the son of Aristophantus, a man of the
greatest weight among the Delphians; and this Cobon prevailed upon
Perialla, the prophetess, to give the answer which Cleomenes wished.
Accordingly, when the sacred messengers came and put their question,
the Pythoness returned for answer "that Demaratus was not Ariston's
son." Some time afterwards all this became known; and Cobon was forced
to fly from Delphi; while Perialla the prophetess was deprived of
her office.

Such were the means whereby the deposition of Demaratus was
brought about; but his flying from Sparta to the Medes was by reason
of an affront which was put upon him. On losing his kingdom he had
been made a magistrate; and in that office soon afterwards, when the
feast of the Gymnopaediae came around, he took his station among the
 lookers-on; whereupon Leotychides, who was now king in his room, sent
a servant to him and asked him, by way of insult and mockery, "how
it felt to be a magistrate after one had been a king?" Demaratus,
who was hurt at the question, made answer- "Tell him I have tried them
both, but he has not. Howbeit this speech will be the cause to
Sparta of infinite blessings or else of infinite woes." Having thus
spoken he wrapped his head in his robe, and, leaving the theatre, went
home to his own house, where he prepared an ox for sacrifice, and
offered it to Jupiter, after which he called for his mother.

When she appeared, he took of the entrails, and placing them in
her hand, besought her in these words following:-

"Dear mother, I beseech you, by all the gods, and chiefly by our
own hearth-god Jupiter, tell me the very truth, who was really my
father. For Leotychides, in the suit which we had together, declared
that when thou becamest Ariston's wife thou didst already bear in
thy womb a child by thy former husband, and others repeat a yet more
disgraceful tale, that our groom found favour in thine eyes, and
that I am his son. I entreat thee therefore by the gods to tell me the
truth. For if thou hast gone astray, thou hast done no more than
many a woman; and the Spartans remark it as strange, if I am Ariston's
son, that he had no children by his other wives."

Thus spake Demaratus; and his mother replied as follows: "Dear
son, since thou entreatest so earnestly for the truth, it shall indeed
be fully told to thee. When Ariston brought me to his house, on the
third night after my coming, there appeared to me one like to Ariston,
who, after staying with me a while, rose, and taking the garlands from
his own brows placed them upon my head, and so went away. Presently
after Ariston entered, and when he saw the garlands which I still
wore, asked me who gave them to me. I said, 'twas he; but this he
stoutly denied; whereupon I solemnly swore that it was none other, and
told him he did not do well to dissemble when he had so lately risen
from my side and left the garlands with me. Then Ariston, when he
heard my oath, understood that there was something beyond nature in
what had taken place. And indeed it appeared that the garlands had
come from the hero-temple which stands by our court gates- the
temple of him they call Astrabacus- and the soothsayers, moreover,
declared that the apparition was that very person. And now, my son,
I have told thee all thou wouldest fain know. Either thou art the
son of that hero- either thou mayest call Astrabacus sire; or else
Ariston was thy father. As for that matter which they who hate thee
urge the most, the words of Ariston, who, when the messenger told
him of thy birth, declared before many witnesses that 'thou wert not
his son, forasmuch as the ten months were not fully out,' it was a
random speech, uttered from mere ignorance. The truth is, children are
born not only at ten months, but at nine, and even at seven. Thou wert
thyself, my son, a seven months' child. Ariston acknowledged, no
long time afterwards, that his speech sprang from thoughtlessness.
Hearken not then to other tales concerning thy birth, my son: for be
assured thou hast the whole truth. As for grooms, pray Heaven
Leotychides and all who speak as he does may suffer wrong from
them!" Such was the mother's answer.

Demaratus, having learnt all that he wished to know, took with him
provision for the journey, and went into Elis, pretending that he
purposed to proceed to Delphi, and there consult the oracle. The
Lacedaemonians, however, suspecting that he meant to fly his
country, sent men in pursuit of him; but Demaratus hastened, and
leaving Elis before they arrived, sailed across to Zacynthus. The
Lacedaemonians followed, and sought to lay hands upon him, and to
separate him from his retinue; but the Zacynthians would not give
him up to them: so he escaping, made his way afterwards by sea to
Asia, and presented himself before King Darius, who received him
generously, and gave him both lands and cities. Such was the chance
which drove Demaratus to Asia, a man distinguished among the
Lacedaemonians for many noble deeds and wise counsels, and who alone
of all the Spartan kings brought honour to his country by winning at
Olympia the prize in the four-horse chariot-race.

After Demaratus was deposed, Leotychides, the son of Menares,
received the kingdom. He had a son, Zeuxidamus, called Cyniscus by
many of the Spartans. This Zeuxidamus did not reign at Sparta, but
died before his father, leaving a son, Archidamus. Leotychides, when
Zeuxidamus was taken from him, married a second wife, named
Eurydame, the sister of Menius and daughter of Diactorides. By her
he had no male offspring, but only a daughter called Lampito, whom
he gave in marriage to Archidamus, Zeuxidamus' son.

Even Leotychides, however, did not spend his old age in Sparta,
but suffered a punishment whereby Demaratus was fully avenged. He
commanded the Lacedaemonians when they made war against Thessaly,
and might have conquered the whole of it, but was bribed by a large
sum of money. It chanced that he was caught in the fact, being found
sitting in his tent on a gauntlet, quite full of silver. Upon this
he was brought to trial and banished from Sparta; his house was
razed to the ground; and he himself fled to Tegea, where he ended
his days. But these events took place long afterwards.

At the time of which we are speaking, Cleomenes, having carried
his proceedings in the matter of Demaratus to a prosperous issue,
forthwith took Leotychides with him, and crossed over to attack the
Eginetans; for his anger was hot against them on account of the
affront which they had formerly put upon him. Hereupon the
Eginetans, seeing that both the kings were come against them,
thought it best to make no further resistance. So the two kings picked
out from all Egina the ten men who for wealth and birth stood the
highest, among whom were Crius, son of Polycritus, and Casambus, son
of Aristocrates, who wielded the chief power; and these men they
carried with them to Attica, and there deposited them in the hands
of the Athenians, the great enemies of the Eginetans.

Afterwards, when it came to be known what evil arts had been
used against Demaratus, Cleomenes was seized with fear of his own
countrymen, and fled into Thessaly. From thence he passed into
Arcadia, where he began to stir up troubles, and endeavoured to
unite the Arcadians against Sparta. He bound them by various oaths
to follow him whithersoever he should lead, and was even desirous of
taking their chief leaders with him to the city of Nonacris, that he
might swear them to his cause by the waters of the Styx. For the
waters of Styx, as the Arcadians say, are in that city, and this is
the appearance they present: you see a little water, dripping from a
rock into a basin, which is fenced round by a low wall. Nonacris,
where this fountain is to be seen, is a city of Arcadia near Pheneus.

 When the Lacedaemonians heard how Cleomenes was engaged, they
were afraid, and agreed with him that he should come back to Sparta
and be king as before. So Cleomenes came back; but had no sooner
returned than he, who had never been altogether of sound mind, was
smitten with downright madness. This he showed by striking every
Spartan he met upon the face with his sceptre. On his behaving thus,
and showing that he was gone quite out of his mind, his kindred
imprisoned him, and even put his feet in the stocks. While so bound,
finding himself left alone with a single keeper, he asked the man
for a knife. The keeper at first refused, whereupon Cleomenes began to
threaten him, until at last he was afraid, being only a helot, and
gave him what he required. Cleomenes had no sooner got the steel than,
beginning at his legs, he horribly disfigured himself, cutting
gashes in his flesh, along his legs, thighs, hips, and loins, until at
last he reached his belly, which he likewise began to gash,
whereupon in a little time he died. The Greeks generally think that
this fate came upon him because he induced the Pythoness to
pronounce against Demaratus; the Athenians differ from all others in
saying that it was because he cut down the sacred grove of the
goddesses when he made his invasion by Eleusis; while the Argives
ascribe it to his having taken from their refuge and cut to pieces
certain argives who had fled from battle into a precinct sacred to
Argus, where Cleomenes slew them, burning likewise at the same time,
through irreverence, the grove itself.

For once, when Cleomenes had sent to Delphi to consult the oracle,
it was prophesied to him that he should take Argos; upon which he went
out at the head of the Spartans, and led them to the river Erasinus.
This stream is reported to flow from the Stymphalian lake, the
waters of which empty themselves into a pitch-dark chasm, and then (as
they say) reappear in Argos, where the Argives call them the Erasinus.
Cleomenes, having arrived upon the banks of this river, proceeded to
offer sacrifice to it, but, in spite of all that he could do, the
victims were not favourable to his crossing. So he said that he
admired the god for refusing to betray his countrymen, but still the
Argives should not escape him for all that. He then withdrew his
troops, and led them down to Thyrea, where he sacrificed a bull to the
sea, and conveyed his men on shipboard to Nauplia in the Tirynthian
territory.

The Argives, when they heard of this, marched down to the sea to
defend their country; and arriving in the neighbourhood of Tiryns,
at the place which bears the name of Sepeia, they pitched their camp
opposite to the Lacedaemonians, leaving no great space between the
hosts. And now their fear was not so much lest they should be
worsted in open fight as lest some trick should be practised on
them; for such was the danger which the oracle given to them in common
with the Milesians seemed to intimate. The oracle ran as follows:-


Time shall be when the female shall conquer the male, and shall

  chase him

Far away- gaining so great praise and honour in Argos;

Then full many an Argive woman her cheeks shall mangle

Hence, in the times to come 'twill be said by the men who are

  unborn,

"Tamed by the spear expired the coiled terrible serpent."

At the coincidence of all these things the Argives were greatly cast
down; and so they resolved that they would follow the signals of the
enemy's herald. Having made this resolve, they proceeded to act as
follows: whenever the herald of the Lacedaemonians gave an order to
the soldiers of his own army, the Argives did the like on their side.

Now when Cleomenes heard that the Argives were acting thus, he
commanded his troops that, so soon as the herald gave the word for the
soldiers to go to dinner, they should instantly seize their arms and
charge the host of the enemy. Which the Lacedaemonians did
accordingly, and fell upon the Argives just as, following the
signal, they had begun their repast; whereby it came to pass that vast
numbers of the Argives were slain, while the rest, who were more
than they which died in the fight, were driven to take refuge in the
grove of Argus hard by, where they were surrounded, and watch kept
upon them.

When things were at this pass Cleomenes acted as follows: Having
learnt the names of the Argives who were shut up in the sacred
precinct from certain deserters who had come over to him, he sent a
herald to summon them one by one, on pretence of having received their
ransoms. Now the ransom of prisoners among the Peloponnesians is fixed
at two minae the man. So Cleomenes had these persons called forth
severally, to the number of fifty, or thereabouts, and massacred them.
All this while they who remained in the enclosure knew nothing of what
was happening; for the grove was so thick that the people inside
were unable to see what was taking place without. But at last one of
their number climbed up into a tree and spied the treachery; after
which none of those who were summoned would go forth.

Then Cleomenes ordered all the helots to bring brushwood, and heap
it around the grove; which was done accordingly; and Cleomenes set the
grove on fire. As the flames spread he asked a deserter "Who was the
god of the grove?" whereto the other made answer, "Argus." So he, when
he heard that, uttered a loud groan, and said:-

"Greatly hast thou deceived me, Apollo, god of prophecy, in saying
that I should take Argos. I fear me thy oracle has now got its
accomplishment."

Cleomenes now sent home the greater part of his army, while with a
thousand of his best troops he proceeded to the temple of Juno, to
offer sacrifice. When however he would have slain the victim on the
altar himself, the priest forbade him, as it was not lawful (he
said) for a foreigner to sacrifice in that temple. At this Cleomenes
ordered his helots to drag the priest from the altar and scourge
him, while he performed the sacrifice himself, after which he went
back to Sparta.

Thereupon his enemies brought him up before the Ephors, and made
it a charge against him that he had allowed himself to be bribed,
and on that account had not taken Argos when he might have captured it
easily. To this he answered- whether truly or falsely I cannot say
with certainty- but at any rate his answer to the charge was that
"so soon as he discovered the sacred precinct which he had taken to
belong to Argos, he directly imagined that the oracle had received its
accomplishment; he therefore thought it not good to attempt the
town, at the least until he had inquired by sacrifice, and ascertained
if the god meant to grant him the place, or was determined to oppose
his taking it. So he offered in the temple of Juno, and when the omens
were propitious, immediately there flashed forth a flame of fire
from the breast of the image; whereby he knew of a surety that he
was not to take Argos. For if the flash had come from the head, he
would have gained the town, citadel and all; but as it shone from
the breast, he had done so much as the god intended." And his words
seemed to the Spartans so true and reasonable, that he came clear
off from his adversaries.

Argos however was left so bare of men that the slaves managed
the state, filled the offices, and administered everything until the
sons of those who were slain by Cleomenes grew up. Then these latter
cast out the slaves, and got the city back under their own rule; while
the slaves who had been driven out fought a battle and won Tiryns.
After this for a time there was peace between the two; but a certain
man, a soothsayer, named Cleander, who was by race a Phigalean from
Arcadia, joined himself to the slaves, and stirred them up to make a
fresh attack upon their lords. Then were they at war with one
another by the space of many years; but at length the Argives with
much trouble gained the upper hand.

The Argives say that Cleomenes lost his senses, and died so
miserably, on account of these doings. But his own countrymen
declare that his madness proceeded not from any supernatural cause
whatever, but only from the habit of drinking wine unmixed with water,
which he learnt of the Scyths. These nomads, from the time that Darius
made his inroad into their country, had always had a wish for revenge.
They therefore sent ambassadors to Sparta to conclude a league,
proposing to endeavour themselves to enter Media by the Phasis,
while the Spartans should march inland from Ephesus, and then the
two armies should join together in one. When the Scyths came to Sparta
on this errand Cleomenes was with them continually; and growing
somewhat too familiar, learnt of them to drink his wine without water,
a practice which is thought by the Spartans to have caused his
madness. From this distance of time the Spartans, according to their
own account, have been accustomed, when they want to drink purer
wine than common, to give the order to fill "Scythian fashion." The
Spartans then speak thus concerning Cleomenes; but for my own part I
think his death was a judgment on him for wronging Demaratus.

No sooner did the news of Cleomenes' death reach Egina than
straightway the Eginetans sent ambassadors to Sparta to complain of
the conduct of Leotychides in respect of their hostages, who were
still kept at Athens. So they of Lacedaemon assembled a court of
justice and gave sentence upon Leotychides, that whereas he had
grossly affronted the people of Egina, he should be given up to the
ambassadors, to be led away in place of the men whom the Athenians had
in their keeping. Then the ambassadors were about to lead him away;
but Theasides, the son of Leoprepes, who was a man greatly esteemed in
Sparta, interfered, and said to them:-

"What are ye minded to do, ye men of Egina? To lead away captive
the king of the Spartans, whom his countrymen have given into your
hands? Though now in their anger they have passed this sentence, yet
belike the time will come when they will punish you, if you act
thus, by bringing utter destruction upon your country."

The Eginetans, when they heard this, changed their plan, and,
instead of leading Leotychides away captive, agreed with him that he
should come with them to Athens, and give them back their men.

When however he reached that city, and demanded the restoration of
his pledge, the Athenians, being unwilling to comply, proceeded to
make excuses, saying "that two kings had come and left the men with
them, and they did not think it right to give them back to the one
without the other." So when the Athenians refused plainly to restore
the men, Leotychides said to them:-

"Men of Athens, act which way you choose- give me up the hostages,
and be righteous, or keep them, and be the contrary. I wish,
however, to tell you what happened once in Sparta about a pledge.
The story goes among us that three generations back there lived in
Lacedaemon one Glaucus, the son of Epicydes, a man who in every
other respect was on a par with the first in the kingdom, and whose
character for justice was such as to place him above all the other
Spartans. Now to this man at the appointed season the following events
happened. A certain Milesian came to Sparta and, having desired to
speak with him, said- 'I am of Miletus, and I have come hither,
Glaucus, in the hope of profiting by thy honesty. For when I heard
much talk thereof in Ionia and through all the rest of Greece, and
when I observed that whereas Ionia is always insecure, the Peloponnese
stands firm and unshaken, and noted likewise how wealth is continually
changing hands in our country, I took counsel with myself and resolved
to turn one-half of my substance into money, and place it in thy
hands, since I am well assured that it will be safe in thy keeping.
Here then is the silver- take it- and take likewise these tallies, and
be careful of them; remember thou art to give back the money to the
person who shall bring you their fellows.' Such were the words of
the Milesian stranger; and Glaucus took the deposit on the terms
expressed to him. Many years had gone by when the sons of the man by
whom the money was left came to Sparta, and had an interview with
Glaucus, whereat they produced the tallies, and asked to have the
money returned to them. But Glaucus sought to refuse, and answered
them: 'I have no recollection of the matter; nor can I bring to mind
any of those particulars whereof ye speak. When I remember, I will
certainly do what is just. If I had the money, you have a right to
receive it back; but if it was never given to me, I shall put the
Greek law in force against you. For the present I give you no
answer; but four months hence I will settle the business.' So the
Milesians went away sorrowful, considering that their money was
utterly lost to them. As for Glaucus, he made a journey to Delphi, and
there consulted the oracle. To his question if he should swear, and so
make prize of the money, the Pythoness returned for answer these lines
following:-


Best for the present it were, O Glaucus, to do as thou wishest,

Swearing an oath to prevail, and so to make prize of the money.

Swear then- death is the lot e'en of those who never swear
falsely.

Yet hath the Oath-God a son who is nameless, footless, and

  handless;

Mighty in strength he approaches to vengeance, and whelms in

  destruction,

All who belong to the race, or the house of the man who is

  perjured.

But oath- keeping men leave behind them a flourishing offspring.

Glaucus when he heard these words earnestly besought the god to pardon
his question; but the Pythoness replied that it was as bad to have
tempted the god as it would have been to have done the deed.
Glaucus, however, sent for the Milesian strangers, and gave them
back their money. And now I will tell you, Athenians, what my
purpose has been in recounting to you this history. Glaucus at the
present time has not a single descendant; nor is there any family
known as his- root and branch has he been removed from Sparta. It is a
good thing, therefore, when a pledge has been left with one, not
even in thought to doubt about restoring it."

Thus spake Leotychides; but, as he found that the Athenians
would not hearken to him, he left them and went his way.

The Eginetans had never been punished for the wrongs which, to
pleasure the Thebans, they had committed upon Athens. Now, however,
conceiving that they were themselves wronged, and had a fair ground of
complaint against the Athenians, they instantly prepared to revenge
themselves. As it chanced that the Athenian theoris, which was a
vessel of five banks of oars, lay at Sunium, the Eginetans contrived
an ambush, and made themselves masters of the holy vessel, on board of
which were a number of Athenians of the highest rank, whom they took
and threw into prison.

At this outrage the Athenians no longer delayed, but set to work
to scheme their worst against the Eginetans; and, as there was in
Egina at that time a man of mark, Nicodromus by name, the son of
Cnoethus, who was on ill terms with his countrymen because on a former
occasion they had driven him into banishment, they listened to
overtures from this man, who had heard how determined they were to
do the Eginetans a mischief, and agreed with him that on a certain day
he should be ready to betray the island into their hands, and they
would come with a body of troops to his assistance. And Nicodromus,
some time after, holding to the agreement, made himself master of what
is called the old town.

The Athenians, however, did not come to the day; for their own
fleet was not of force sufficient to engage the Eginetans, and while
they were begging the Corinthians to lend them some ships, the failure
of the enterprise took place. In those days the Corinthians were on
the best of terms with the Athenians; and accordingly they now yielded
to their request, and furnished them with twenty ships; but, as
their law did not allow the ships to be given for nothing, they sold
them to the Athenians for five drachms apiece. As soon then as the
Athenians had obtained this aid, and, by manning also their own ships,
had equipped a fleet of seventy sail, they crossed over to Egina,
but arrived a day later than the time agreed upon.

Meanwhile Nicodromus, when he found the Athenians did not come
to the time appointed, took ship and made his escape from the
island. The Eginetans who accompanied him were settled by the
Athenians at Sunium, whence they were wont to issue forth and
plunder the Eginetans of the island. But this took place at a later
date.

When the wealthier Eginetans had thus obtained the victory over
the common people who had revolted with Nicodromus, they laid hands on
a certain number of them, and led them out to death. But here they
were guilty of a sacrilege, which, notwithstanding all their
efforts, they were never able to atone, being driven from the island
before they had appeased the goddess whom they now provoked. Seven
hundred of the common people had fallen alive into their hands; and
they were all being led out to death, when one of them escaped from
his chains, and flying to the gateway of the temple of Ceres the
Lawgiver, laid hold of the doorhandles, and clung to them. The
others sought to drag him from his refuge; but, finding themselves
unable to tear him away, they cut off his hands, and so took him,
leaving the hands still tightly grasping the handles.

Such were the doings of the Eginetans among themselves. When the
Athenians arrived, they went out to meet them with seventy ships;
and a battle took place, wherein the Eginetans suffered a defeat.
Hereupon they had recourse again to their old allies, the Argives; but
these latter refused now to lend them any aid, being angry because
some Eginetan ships, which Cleomenes had taken by force, accompanied
him in his invasion of Argolis, and joined in the disembarkation.
The same thing had happened at the same time With certain vessels of
the Sicyonians; and the Argives had laid a fine of a thousand
talents upon the misdoers, five hundred upon each: whereupon they of
Sicyon acknowledged themselves to have sinned, and agreed with the
Argives to pay them a hundred talents, and so be quit of the debt; but
the Eginetans would make no acknowledgment at all, and showed
themselves proud and stiffnecked. For this reason, when they now
prayed the Argives for aid, the state refused to send them a single
soldier. Notwithstanding, volunteers joined them from Argos to the
number of a thousand, under a captain, Eurybates, a man skilled in the
pentathlic contests. Of these men the greater part never returned, but
were slain by the Athenians in Egina. Eurybates, their captain, fought
a number of single combats, and, after killing three men in this
way, was himself slain by the fourth, who was a Decelean, named
Sophanes.

Afterwards the Eginetans fell upon the Athenian fleet when it
was in some disorder and beat it, capturing four ships with their
crews.

Thus did war rage between the Eginetans and Athenians. Meantime
the Persian pursued his own design, from day to day exhorted by his
servant to "remember the Athenians," and likewise urged continually by
the Pisistratidae, who were ever accusing their countrymen. Moreover
it pleased him well to have a pretext for carrying war into Greece,
that so he might reduce all those who had refused to give him earth
and water. As for Mardonius, since his expedition had succeeded so
ill, Darius took the command of the troops from him, and appointed
other generals in his stead, who were to lead the host against Eretria
and Athens; to wit, Datis, who was by descent a Mede, and Artaphernes,
the son of Artaphernes, his own nephew. These men received orders to
carry Athens and Eretria away captive, and to bring the prisoners into
his presence.

So the new commanders took their departure from the court and went
down to Cilicia, to the Aleian plain, having with them a numerous
and wellappointed land army. Encamping here, they were joined by the
sea force which had been required of the several states, and at the
same time by the horsetransports which Darius had, the year before,
commanded his tributaries to make ready. Aboard these the horses
were embarked; and the troops were received by the ships of war; after
which the whole fleet, amounting in all to six hundred triremes,
made sail for Ionia. Thence, instead of proceeding with a straight
course along the shore to the Hellespont and to Thrace, they loosed
from Samos and voyaged across the Icarian sea through the midst of the
islands; mainly, as I believe, because they feared the danger of
doubling Mount Athos, where the year before they had suffered so
grievously on their passage; but a constraining cause also was their
former failure to take Naxos.

When the Persians, therefore, approaching from the Icarian Sea,
cast anchor at Naxos, which, recollecting what there befell them
formerly, they had determined to attack before any other state, the
Naxians, instead of encountering them, took to flight, and hurried off
to the hills. The Persians however succeeded in laying hands on
some, and them they carried away captive, while at the same time
they burnt all the temples together with the town. This done, they
left Naxos, and sailed away to the other islands.

While the Persians were thus employed, the Delians likewise
quitted Delos, and took refuge in Tenos. And now the expedition drew
near, when Datis sailed forward in advance of the other ships;
commanding them, instead of anchoring at Delos, to rendezvous at
Rhenea, over against Delos, while he himself proceeded to discover
whither the Delians had fled; after which he sent a herald to them
with this message:

"Why are ye fled, O holy men? Why have ye judged me so harshly and
so wrongfully? I have surely sense enough, even had not the king so
ordered, to spare the country which gave birth to the two gods- to
spare, I say, both the country and its inhabitants. Come back
therefore to your dwellings; and once more inhabit your island."

Such was the message which Datis sent by his herald to the
Delians. He likewise placed upon the altar three hundred talents'
weight of frankincense, and offered it.

After this he sailed with his whole host against Eretria, taking
with him both Ionians and Aeolians. When he was departed, Delos (as
the Delians told me) was shaken by an earthquake, the first and last
shock that has been felt to this day. And truly this was a prodigy
whereby the god warned men of the evils that were coming upon them.
For in the three following generations of Darius the son of Hystaspes,
Xerxes the son of Darius, and Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes, more
woes befell Greece than in the twenty generations preceding Darius-
woes caused in part by the Persians, but in part arising from the
contentions among their own chief men respecting the supreme power.
Wherefore it is not surprising that Delos, though it had never
before been shaken, should at that time have felt the shock of an
earthquake. And indeed there was an oracle, which said of Delos-


Delo's self will I shake, which never yet has been

  shaken

Of the above names Darius may be rendered "Worker," Xerxes
"Warrior," and Artaxerxes "Great Warrior." And so might we call
these kings in our own language with propriety.

The barbarians, after loosing from Delos, proceeded to touch at
the other islands, and took troops from each, and likewise carried off
a number of the children as hostages. Going thus from one to
another, they came at last to Carystus; but here the hostages were
refused by the Carystians, who said they would neither give any, nor
consent to bear arms against the cities of their neighbours, meaning
Athens and Eretria. Hereupon the Persians laid siege to Carystus,
and wasted the country round, until at length the inhabitants were
brought over and agreed to do what was required of them.

Meanwhile the Eretrians, understanding that the Persian armament
was coming against them, besought the Athenians for assistance. Nor
did the Athenians refuse their aid, but assigned to them as
auxiliaries the four thousand landholders to whom they had allotted
the estates of the Chalcidean Hippobatae. At Eretria, however,
things were in no healthy state; for though they had called in the aid
of the Athenians, yet they were not agreed among themselves how they
should act; some of them were minded to leave the city and to take
refuge in the heights of Euboea, while others, who looked to receiving
a reward from the Persians, were making ready to betray their country.
So when these things came to the ears of Aeschines, the son of Nothon,
one of the first men in Eretria, he made known the whole state of
affairs to the Athenians who were already arrived, and besought them
to return home to their own land, and not perish with his
countrymen. And the Athenians hearkened to his counsel, and,
crossing over to Oropus, in this way escaped the danger.

The Persian fleet now drew near and anchored at Tamynae, Choereae,
and Aegilia, three places in the territory of Eretria. Once masters of
these posts, they proceeded forthwith to disembark their horses, and
made ready to attack the enemy. But the Eretrians were not minded to
sally forth and offer battle; their only care, after it had been
resolved not to quit the city, was, if possible, to defend their
walls. And now the fortress was assaulted in good earnest, and for six
days there fell on both sides vast numbers, but on the seventh day
Euphorbus, the son of Alcimachus, and Philagrus, the son of Cyneas,
who were both citizens of good repute, betrayed the place to the
Persians. These were no sooner entered within the walls than they
plundered and burnt all the temples that there were in the town, in
revenge for the burning of their own temples at Sardis; moreover, they
did according to the orders of Darius, and carried away captive all
the inhabitants.

The Persians, having thus brought Eretria into subjection after
waiting a few days, made sail for Attica, greatly straitening the
Athenians as they approached, and thinking to deal with them as they
had dealt with the people of Eretria. And, because there was no
Place in all Attica so convenient for their horse as Marathon, and
it lay moreover quite close to Eretria, therefore Hippias, the son
of Pisistratus, conducted them thither.

When intelligence of this reached the Athenians, they likewise
marched their troops to Marathon, and there stood on the defensive,
having at their head ten generals, of whom one was Miltiades.

Now this man's father, Cimon, the son of Stesagoras, was
banished from Athens by Pisistratus, the son of Hippocrates. In his
banishment it was his fortune to win the four-horse chariot-race at
Olympia, whereby he gained the very same honour which had before
been carried off by Miltiades, his half-brother on the mother's
side. At the next Olympiad he won the prize again with the same mares;
upon which he caused Pisistratus to be proclaimed the winner, having
made an agreement with him that on yielding him this honour he
should be allowed to come back to his country. Afterwards, still
with the same mares, he won the prize a third time; whereupon he was
put to death by the sons of Pisistratus, whose father was no longer
living. They set men to lie in wait for him secretly; and these men
slew him near the government-house in the night-time. He was buried
outside the city, beyond what is called the Valley Road; and right
opposite his tomb were buried the mares which had won the three
prizes. The same success had likewise been achieved once previously,
to wit, by the mares of Evagoras the Lacedaemonian, but never except
by them. At the time of Cimon's death Stesagoras, the elder of his two
sons, was in the Chersonese, where he lived with Miltiades his
uncle; the younger, who was called Miltiades after the founder of
the Chersonesite colony, was with his father in Athens.

It was this Miltiades who now commanded the Athenians, after
escaping from the Chersonese, and twice nearly losing his life.
First he was chased as far as Imbrus by the Phoenicians, who had a
great desire to take him and carry him up to the king; and when he had
avoided this danger, and, having reached his own country, thought
himself to be altogether in safety, he found his enemies waiting for
him, and was cited by them before a court and impeached for his
tyranny in the Chersonese. But he came off victorious here likewise,
and was thereupon made general of the Athenians by the free choice
of the people.

And first, before they left the city, the generals sent off to
Sparta a herald, one Pheidippides, who was by birth an Athenian, and
by profession and practice a trained runner. This man, according to
the account which he gave to the Athenians on his return, when he
was near Mount Parthenium, above Tegea, fell in with the god Pan,
who called him by his name, and bade him ask the Athenians
"wherefore they neglected him so entirely, when he was kindly disposed
towards them, and had often helped them in times past, and would do so
again in time to come?" The Athenians, entirely believing in the truth
of this report, as soon as their affairs were once more in good order,
set up a temple to Pan under the Acropolis, and, in return for the
message which I have recorded, established in his honour yearly
sacrifices and a torch-race.

On the occasion of which we speak when Pheidippides was sent by
the Athenian generals, and, according to his own account, saw Pan on
his journey, he reached Sparta on the very next day after quitting the
city of Athens- Upon his arrival he went before the rulers, and said
to them:-

"Men of Lacedaemon, the Athenians beseech you to hasten to their
aid, and not allow that state, which is the most ancient in all
Greece, to be enslaved by the barbarians. Eretria, look you, is
already carried away captive; and Greece weakened by the loss of no
mean city."

Thus did Pheidippides deliver the message committed to him. And
the Spartans wished to help the Athenians, but were unable to give
them any present succour, as they did not like to break their
established law. It was then the ninth day of the first decade; and
they could not march out of Sparta on the ninth, when the moon had not
reached the full. So they waited for the full of the moon.

The barbarians were conducted to Marathon by Hippias. the son of
Pisistratus, who the night before had seen a strange vision in his
sleep. He dreamt of lying in his mother's arms, and conjectured the
dream to mean that he would be restored to Athens, recover the power
which he had lost, and afterwards live to a good old age in his native
country. Such was the sense in which he interpreted the vision. He now
proceeded to act as guide to the Persians; and, in the first place, he
landed the prisoners taken from Eretria upon the island that is called
Aegileia, a tract belonging to the Styreans, after which he brought
the fleet to anchor off Marathon, and marshalled the bands of the
barbarians as they disembarked. As he was thus employed it chanced
that he sneezed and at the same time coughed with more violence than
was his wont. Now, as he was a man advanced in years, and the
greater number of his teeth were loose, it so happened that one of
them was driven out with the force of the cough, and fell down into
the sand. Hippias took all the pains he could to find it; but the
tooth was nowhere to be seen: whereupon he fetched a deep sigh, and
said to the bystanders:-

"After all, the land is not ours; and we shall never be able to
bring it under. All my share in it is the portion of which my tooth
has possession."

So Hippias believed that in this way his dream was fulfilled.

The Athenians were drawn up in order of battle in a sacred close
belonging to Hercules, when they were joined by the Plataeans, who
came in full force to their aid. Some time before, the Plataeans had
put themselves under the rule of the Athenians; and these last had
already undertaken many labours on their behalf. The occasion of the
surrender was the following. The Plataeans suffered grievous things at
the hands of the men of Thebes; so, as it chanced that Cleomenes,
the son of Anaxandridas, and the Lacedaemonians were in their
neighbourhood, they first of all offered to surrender themselves to
them. But the Lacedaemonians refused to receive them, and said:-

"We dwell too far off from you, and ours would be but chill
succour. Ye might oftentimes be carried into slavery before one of
us heard of it. We counsel you rather to give yourselves up to the
Athenians, who are your next neighbours, and well able to shelter
you."

This they said, not so much out of good will towards the Plataeans
as because they wished to involve the Athenians in trouble by engaging
them in wars with the Boeotians. The Plataeans, however, when the
Lacedaemonians gave them this counsel, complied at once; and when
the sacrifice to the Twelve Gods was being offered at Athens, they
came and sat as suppliants about the altar, and gave themselves up
to the Athenians. The Thebans no sooner learnt what the Plataeans
had done than instantly they marched out against them, while the
Athenians sent troops to their aid. As the two armies were about to
join battle, the Corinthians, who chanced to be at hand, would not
allow them to engage; both sides consented to take them for
arbitrators, whereupon they made up the quarrel, and fixed the
boundary-line between the two states upon this condition: to wit, that
if any of the Boeotians wished no longer to belong to Boeotia, the
Thebans should allow them to follow their own inclinations. The
Corinthians, when they had thus decreed, forthwith departed to their
homes: the Athenians likewise set off on their return; but the
Boeotians fell upon them during the march, and a battle was fought
wherein they were worsted by the Athenians. Hereupon these last
would not be bound by the line which the Corinthians had fixed, but
advanced beyond those limits, and made the Asopus the boundary-line
between the country of the Thebans and that of the Plataeans and
Hysians. Under such circumstances did the Plataeans give themselves up
to Athens; and now they were come to Marathon to bear the Athenians
aid.

The Athenian generals were divided in their opinions; and some
advised not to risk a battle, because they were too few to engage such
a host as that of the Medes, while others were for fighting at once;
and among these last was Miltiades. He therefore, seeing that opinions
were thus divided, and that the less worthy counsel appeared likely to
prevail, resolved to go to the Polemarch, and have a conference with
him. For the man on whom the lot fell to be Polemarch at Athens was
entitled to give his vote with the ten generals, since anciently the
Athenians allowed him an equal right of voting with them. The
Polemarch at this juncture was Callimachus of Aphidnae; to him
therefore Miltiades went, and said:-

"With thee it rests, Callimachus, either to bring Athens to
slavery, or, by securing her freedom, to leave behind thee to all
future generations a memory beyond even Harmodius and Aristogeiton.
For never since the time that the Athenians became a people were
they in so great a danger as now. If they bow their necks beneath
the yoke of the Medes, the woes which they will have to suffer when
given into the power of Hippias are already determined on; if, on
the other hand, they fight and overcome, Athens may rise to be the
very first city in Greece. How it comes to pass that these things
are likely to happen, and how the determining of them in some sort
rests with thee, I will now proceed to make clear. We generals are ten
in number, and our votes are divided; half of us wish to engage,
half to avoid a combat. Now, if we do not fight, I look to see a great
disturbance at Athens which will shake men's resolutions, and then I
fear they will submit themselves; but if we fight the battle before
any unsoundness show itself among our citizens, let the gods but
give us fair play, and we are well able to overcome the enemy. On thee
therefore we depend in this matter, which lies wholly in thine own
power. Thou hast only to add thy vote to my side and thy country
will be free, and not free only, but the first state in Greece. Or, if
thou preferrest to give thy vote to them who would decline the combat,
then the reverse will follow."

Miltiades by these words gained Callimachus; and the addition of
the Polemarch's vote caused the decision to be in favour of
fighting. Hereupon all those generals who had been desirous of
hazarding a battle, when their turn came to command the army, gave
up their right to Miltiades. He however, though he accepted their
offers, nevertheless waited, and would not fight until his own day
of command arrived in due course.

Then at length, when his own turn was come, the Athenian battle
was set in array, and this was the order of it. Callimachus the
Polemarch led the right wing; for it was at that time a rule with
the Athenians to give the right wing to the Polemarch. After this
followed the tribes, according as they were numbered, in an unbroken
line; while last of all came the Plataeans, forming the left wing. And
ever since that day it has been a custom with the Athenians, in the
sacrifices and assemblies held each fifth year at Athens, for the
Athenian herald to implore the blessing of the gods on the Plataeans
conjointly with the Athenians. Now, as they marshalled the host upon
the field of Marathon, in order that the Athenian front might he of
equal length with the Median, the ranks of the centre were diminished,
and it became the weakest part of the line, while the wings were
both made strong with a depth of many ranks.

So when the battle was set in array, and the victims showed
themselves favourable, instantly the Athenians, so soon as they were
let go, charged the barbarians at a run. Now the distance between
the two armies was little short of eight furlongs. The Persians,
therefore, when they saw the Greeks coming on at speed, made ready
to receive them, although it seemed to them that the Athenians were
bereft of their senses, and bent upon their own destruction; for
they saw a mere handful of men coming on at a run without either
horsemen or archers. Such was the opinion of the barbarians; but the
Athenians in close array fell upon them, and fought in a manner worthy
of being recorded. They were the first of the Greeks, so far as I
know, who introduced the custom of charging the enemy at a run, and
they were likewise the first who dared to look upon the Median garb,
and to face men clad in that fashion. Until this time the very name of
the Medes had been a terror to the Greeks to hear.

The two armies fought together on the plain of Marathon for a
length of time; and in the mid battle, where the Persians themselves
and the Sacae had their place, the barbarians were victorious, and
broke and pursued the Greeks into the inner country; but on the two
wings the Athenians and the Plataeans defeated the enemy. Having so
done, they suffered the routed barbarians to fly at their ease, and
joining the two wings in one, fell upon those who had broken their own
centre, and fought and conquered them. These likewise fled, and now
the Athenians hung upon the runaways and cut them down, chasing them
all the way to the shore, on reaching which they laid hold of the
ships and called aloud for fire.

It was in the struggle here that Callimachus the Polemarch,
after greatly distinguishing himself, lost his life; Stesilaus too,
the son of Thrasilaus, one of the generals, was slain; and Cynaegirus,
the son of Euphorion, having seized on a vessel of the enemy's by
the ornament at the stern, had his hand cut off by the blow of an axe,
and so perished; as likewise did many other Athenians of note and
name.

Nevertheless the Athenians secured in this way seven of the
vessels; while with the remainder the barbarians pushed off, and
taking aboard their Eretrian prisoners from the island where they
had left them, doubled Cape Sunium, hoping to reach Athens before
the return of the Athenians. The Alcmaeonidae were accused by their
countrymen of suggesting this course to them; they had, it was said,
an understanding with the Persians, and made a signal to them, by
raising a shield, after they were embarked in their ships.

The Persians accordingly sailed round Sunium. But the Athenians
with all possible speed marched away to the defence of their city, and
succeeded in reaching Athens before the appearance of the
barbarians: and as their camp at Marathon had been pitched in a
precinct of Hercules, so now they encamped in another precinct of
the same god at Cynosarges. The barbarian fleet arrived, and lay to
off Phalerum, which was at that time the haven of Athens; but after
resting awhile upon their oars, they departed and sailed away to Asia.

There fell in this battle of Marathon, on the side of the
barbarians, about six thousand and four hundred men; on that of the
Athenians, one hundred and ninety-two. Such was the number of the
slain on the one side and the other. A strange prodigy likewise
happened at this fight. Epizelus, the son of Cuphagoras, an
Athenian, was in the thick of the fray, and behaving himself as a
brave man should, when suddenly he was stricken with blindness,
without blow of sword or dart; and this blindness continued
thenceforth during the whole of his after life. The following is the
account which he himself, as I have heard, gave of the matter: he said
that a gigantic warrior, with a huge beard, which shaded all his
shield, stood over against him; but the ghostly semblance passed him
by, and slew the man at his side. Such, as I understand, was the
tale which Epizelus told.

Datis meanwhile was on his way back to Asia, and had reached
Myconus, when he saw in his sleep a vision. What it was is not
known; but no sooner was day come than he caused strict search to be
made throughout the whole fleet, and finding on board a Phoenician
vessel an image of Apollo overlaid with gold, he inquired from
whence it had been taken, and learning to what temple it belonged,
he took it with him in his own ship to Delos, and placed it in the
temple there, enjoining the Delians, who had now come back to their
island, to restore the image to the Theban Delium, which lies on the
coast over against Chalcis. Having left these injunctions, he sailed
away; but the Delians failed to restore the statue; and it was not
till twenty years afterwards that the Thebans, warned by an oracle,
themselves brought it back to Delium.

As for the Eretrians, whom Datis and Artaphernes had carried
away captive, when the fleet reached Asia, they were taken up to Susa.
Now King Darius, before they were made his prisoners, nourished a
fierce anger against these men for having injured him without
provocation; but now that he saw them brought into his presence, and
become his subjects, he did them no other harm, but only settled
them at one of his own stations in Cissia- a place called Ardericea-
two hundred and ten furlongs distant from Susa, and forty from the
well which yields produce of three different kinds. For from this well
they get bitumen, salt, and oil, procuring it in the way that I will
now describe: they draw with a swipe, and instead of a bucket make use
of the half of a wine-skin; with this the man dips, and after drawing,
pours the liquid into a reservoir, wherefrom it passes into another,
and there takes three different shapes. The salt and the bitumen
forthwith collect and harden, while the oil is drawn off into casks.
It is called by the Persians "rhadinace," is black, and has an
unpleasant smell. Here then King Darius established the Eretrians; and
here they continued to my time, and still spoke their old language. So
thus it fared with the Eretrians.

After the full of the moon two thousand Lacedaemonians came to
Athens. So eager had they been to arrive in time, that they took but
three days to reach Attica from Sparta. They came, however, too late
for the battle; yet, as they had a longing to behold the Medes, they
continued their march to Marathon and there viewed the slain. Then,
after giving the Athenians all praise for their achievement, they
departed and returned home.
But it fills me with wonderment, and
I can in no wise believe the report, that the Alcmaeonidae had an
understanding with the Persians, and held them up a shield as a
signal, wishing Athens to be brought under the yoke of the
barbarians and of Hippias- the Alcmaeonidae, who have shown themselves
at least as bitter haters of tyrants as was Callias, the son of
Phaenippus, and father of Hipponicus. This Callias was the only person
at Athens who, when the Pisistratidae were driven out, and their goods
were exposed for sale by the vote of the people, had the courage to
make purchases, and likewise in many other ways to display the
strongest hostility.

He was a man very worthy to be had in remembrance by all, on
several accounts. For not only did he thus distinguish himself
beyond others in the cause of his country's freedom; but likewise,
by the honours which he gained at the Olympic Games, where he
carried off the prize in the horse-race, and was second in the
four-horse chariot-race, and by his victory at an earlier period in
the Pythian Games, he showed himself in the eyes of all the Greeks a
man most unsparing in his expenditure. He was remarkable too for his
conduct in respect of his daughters, three in number; for when they
came to be of marriageable age, he gave to each of them a most ample
dowry, and placed it at their own disposal, allowing them to choose
their husbands from among all the citizens of Athens, and giving
each in marriage to the man of her own choice.

Now the Alcmaeonidae fell not a whit short of this person in their
hatred of tyrants, so that I am astonished at the charge made
against them, and cannot bring myself to believe that they held up a
shield; for they were men who had remained in exile during the whole
time that the tyranny lasted, and they even contrived the trick by
which the Pisistratidae were deprived of their throne. Indeed I look
upon them as the persons who in good truth gave Athens her freedom far
more than Harmodius and Aristogeiton. For these last did but
exasperate the other Pisistratidae by slaying Hipparchus, and were far
from doing anything towards putting down the tyranny: whereas the
Alcmaeonidae were manifestly the actual deliverers of Athens, if at
least it be true that the Pythoness was prevailed upon by them to
bid the Lacedaemonians set Athens free, as I have already related.

But perhaps they were offended with the people of Athens; and
therefore betrayed their country. Nay, but on the contrary there
were none of the Athenians who were held in such general esteem, or
who were so laden with honours. So that it is not even reasonable to
suppose that a shield was held up by them on this account. A shield
was shown, no doubt; that cannot be gainsaid; but who it was that
showed it I cannot any further determine.

Now the Alcmaeonidae were, even in days of yore, a family of
note at Athens; but from the time of Alcmaeon, and again of
Megacles, they rose to special eminence. The former of these two
personages, to wit, Alcmaeon, the son of Megacles, when Croesus the
Lydian sent men from Sardis to consult the Delphic oracle, gave aid
gladly to his messengers, assisted them to accomplish their task.
Croesus, informed of Alcmaeon's kindnesses by the Lydians who from
time to time conveyed his messages to the god, sent for him to Sardis,
and when he arrived, made him a present of as much gold as he should
be able to carry at one time about his person. Finding that this was
the gift assigned him, Alcmaeon took his measures, and prepared
himself to receive it in the following way. He clothed himself in a
loose tunic, which he made to bag greatly at the waist, and placing
upon his feet the widest buskins that he could anywhere find, followed
his guides into the treasure-house. Here he fell to upon a heap of
gold-dust, and in the first place packed as much as he could inside
his buskins, between them and his legs; after which he filled the
breast of his tunic quite full of gold, and then sprinkling some among
his hair, and taking some likewise in his mouth, he came forth from
the treasure-house, scarcely able to drag his legs along, like
anything rather than a man, with his mouth crammed full, and his
bulk increased every way. On seeing him, Croesus burst into a laugh,
and not only let him have all that he had taken, but gave him presents
besides of fully equal worth. Thus this house became one of great
wealth; and Alcmaeon was able to keep horses for the chariot-race, and
won the prize at Olympia.

Afterwards, in the generation which followed, Clisthenes, king
of Sicyon, raised the family to still greater eminence among the
Greeks than even that to which it had attained before. For this
Clisthenes, who was the son of Aristonymus, the grandson of Myron, and
the great-grandson of Andreas, had a daughter, called Agarista, whom
he wished to marry to the best husband that he could find in the whole
of Greece. At the Olympic Games, therefore, having gained the prize in
the chariot race, he caused public proclamation to be made to the
following effect:- "Whoever among the Greeks deems himself worthy to
become the son-in-law of Clisthenes, let him come, sixty days hence,
or, if he will, sooner, to Sicyon; for within a year's time,
counting from the end of the sixty days, Clisthenes will decide on the
man to whom he shall contract his daughter." So all the Greeks who
were proud of their own merit or of their country flocked to Sicyon as
suitors; and Clisthenes had a foot-course and a wrestling-ground
made ready, to try their powers.

From Italy there came Smindyrides, the son of Hippocrates, a
native of Sybaris- which city about that time was at the very height
of its prosperity. He was a man who in luxuriousness of living
exceeded all other persons. Likewise there came Damasus, the son of
Amyris, surnamed the Wise, a native of Siris. These two were the
only suitors from Italy. From the Ionian Gulf appeared Amphimnestus,
the son of Epistrophus, an Epidamnian; from Aetolia, Males, the
brother of that Titormus who excelled all the Greeks in strength,
and who wishing to avoid his fellow-men, withdrew himself into the
remotest parts of the Aetolian territory. From the Peloponnese came
several- Leocedes, son of that Pheidon, king of the Argives, who
established weights and measures throughout the Peloponnese, and was
the most insolent of all the Grecians- the same who drove out the
Elean directors of the Games, and himself presided over the contests
at Olympia- Leocedes, I say, appeared, this Pheidon's son; and
likewise Amiantus, son of Lycurgus, an Arcadian of the city of
Trapezus; Laphanes, an Azenian of Paeus, whose father, Euphorion, as
the story goes in Arcadia, entertained the Dioscuri at his
residence, and thenceforth kept open house for all comers; and lastly,
Onomastus, the son of Agaeus, a native of Elis. These four came from
the Peloponnese. From Athens there arrived Megacles, the son of that
Alcmaeon who visited Croesus, and Tisander's son, Hippoclides, the
wealthiest and handsomest of the Athenians. There was likewise one
Euboean, Lysanias, who came from Eretria, then a flourishing city.
>From Thessaly came Diactorides, a Cranonian, of the race of the
Scopadae; and Alcon arrived from the Molossians. This was the list
of the suitors.

Now when they were all come, and the day appointed had arrived,
Clisthenes first of all inquired of each concerning his country and
his family; after which he kept them with him a year, and made trial
of their manly bearing, their temper, their accomplishments, and their
disposition, sometimes drawing them apart for converse, sometimes
bringing them all together. Such as were still youths he took with him
from time to time to the gymnasia; but the greatest trial of all was
at the banquettable. During the whole period of their stay he lived
with them as I have said; and, further, from first to last he
entertained them sumptuously. Somehow or other the suitors who came
from Athens pleased him the best of all; and of these Hippoclides,
Tisander's son, was specially in favour, partly on account of his
manly bearing, and partly also because his ancestors were of kin to
the Corinthian Cypselids.

When at length the day arrived which had been fixed for the
espousals, and Clisthenes had to speak out and declare his choice,
he first of all made a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, and held a
banquet, whereat he entertained all the suitors and the whole people
of Sicyon. After the feast was ended, the suitors vied with each other
in music and in speaking on a given subject. Presently, as the
drinking advanced, Hippoclides, who quite dumbfoundered the rest,
called aloud to the flute-player, and bade him strike up a dance;
which the man did, and Hippoclides danced to it. And he fancied that
he was dancing excellently well; but Clisthenes, who was observing
him, began to misdoubt the whole business. Then Hippoclides, after a
pause, told an attendant to bring in a table; and when it was brought,
he mounted upon it and danced first of all some Laconian figures, then
some Attic ones; after which he stood on his head upon the table,
and began to toss his legs about. Clisthenes, notwithstanding that
he now loathed Hippoclides for a son-in-law, by reason of his
dancing and his shamelessness, still, as he wished to avoid an
outbreak, had restrained himself during the first and likewise
during the second dance; when, however, he saw him tossing his legs in
the air, he could no longer contain himself, but cried out, "Son of
Tisander, thou hast danced thy wife away!" "What does Hippoclides
care?" was the other's answer. And hence the proverb arose.

Then Clisthenes commanded silence, and spake thus before the
assembled company:-

"Suitors of my daughter, well pleased am I with you all; and right
willingly, if it were possible, would I content you all, and not by
making choice of one appear to put a slight upon the rest. But as it
is out of my power, seeing that I have but one daughter, to grant to
all their wishes, I will present to each of you whom I must needs
dismiss a talent of silver, for the honour that you have done me in
seeking to ally yourselves with my house, and for your long absence
from your homes. But my daughter, Agarista, I betroth to Megacles, the
son of Alcmaeon, to be his wife, according to the usage and wont of
Athens."

Then Megacles expressed his readiness; and Clisthenes had the
marriage solemnised.

Thus ended the affair of the suitors; and thus the Alcmaeonidae
came to be famous throughout the whole of Greece. The issue of this
marriage was the Clisthenes named after his grandfather the Sicyonian-
who made the tribes at Athens, and set up the popular government.
Megacles had likewise another son, called Hippocrates, whose
children were a Megacles and an Agarista, the latter named after
Agarista the daughter of Clisthenes. She married Xanthippus, the son
of Ariphron; and when she was with child by him had a dream, wherein
she fancied that she was delivered of a lion; after which, within a
few days, she bore Xanthippus a son, to wit, Pericles.

After the blow struck at Marathon, Miltiades, who was previously
held in high esteem by his countrymen, increased yet more in
influence. Hence, when he told them that he wanted a fleet of
seventy ships, with an armed force, and money, without informing
them what country he was going to attack, but only promising to enrich
them if they would accompany him, seeing that it was a right wealthy
land, where they might easily get as much gold as they cared to
have- when he told them this, they were quite carried away, and gave
him the whole armament which he required.

So Miltiades, having got the armament, sailed against Paros,
with the object, as he alleged, of punishing the Parians for having
gone to war with Athens, inasmuch as a trireme of theirs had come with
the Persian fleet to Marathon. This, however, was a mere pretence; the
truth was, that Miltiades owed the Parians a grudge, because
Lysagoras, the son of Tisias, who was a Parian by birth, had told
tales against him to Hydarnes the Persian. Arrived before the place
against which his expedition was designed, he drove the Parians within
their walls, and forthwith laid siege to the city. At the same time he
sent a herald to the inhabitants, and required of them a hundred
talents, threatening that, if they refused, he would press the
siege, and never give it over till the town was taken. But the
Parians, without giving his demand a thought, proceeded to use every
means that they could devise for the defence of their city, and even
invented new plans for the purpose, one of which was, by working at
night, to raise such parts of the wall as were likely to be carried by
assault to double their former height.

Thus far all the Greeks agree in their accounts of this
business; what follows is related upon the testimony of the Parians
only. Miltiades had come to his wit's end, when one of the
prisoners, a woman named Timo, who was by birth a Parian, and had held
the office of under-priestess in the temple of the infernal goddesses,
came and conferred with him. This woman, they say, being introduced
into the presence of Miltiades, advised him, if he set great store
by the capture of the place, to do something which she could suggest
to him. When therefore she had told him what it was she meant, he
betook himself to the hill which lies in front of the city, and
there leapt the fence enclosing the precinct of Ceres Thesmophorus,
since he was not able to open the door. After leaping into the place
he went straight to the sanctuary, intending to do something within
it- either to remove some of the holy things which it was not lawful
to stir, or to perform some act or other, I cannot say what- and had
just reached the door, when suddenly a feeling of horror came upon
him, and he returned back the way he had come; but in jumping down
from the outer wall, he strained his thigh, or, as some say, struck
the ground with his knee.

So Miltiades returned home sick, without bringing the Athenians
any money, and without conquering Paros, having done no more than to
besiege the town for six-and-twenty days, and ravage the remainder
of the island. The Parians, however, when it came to their knowledge
that Timo, the under-priestess of the goddesses, had advised Miltiades
what he should do, were minded to punish her for her crime; they
therefore sent messengers to Delphi, as soon as the siege was at an
end, and asked the god if they should put the under-priestess to
death. "She had discovered," they said, "to the enemies of her country
how they might bring it into subjection, and had exhibited to
Miltiades mysteries which it was not lawful for a man to know." But
the Pythoness forbade them, and said, "Timo was not in fault; 'twas
decreed that Miltiades should come to an unhappy end; and she was sent
to lure him to his destruction." Such was the answer given to the
Parians by the Pythoness.

The Athenians, upon the return of Miltiades from Paros, had much
debate concerning him; and Xanthippus, the son of Ariphron, who
spoke more freely against him than all the rest, impleaded him
before the people, and brought him to trial for his life, on the
charge of having dealt deceitfully with the Athenians. Miltiades,
though he was present in court, did not speak in his own defence;
for his thigh had begun to mortify, and disabled him from pleading his
cause. He was forced to lie on a couch while his defence was made by
his friends, who dwelt at most length on the fight at Marathon,
while they made mention also of the capture of Lemnos, telling how
Miltiades took the island, and, after executing vengeance on the
Pelasgians, gave up his conquest to Athens. The judgment of the people
was in his favour so far as to spare his life; but for the wrong he
had done them they fined him fifty talents. Soon afterwards his
thigh completely gangrened and mortified: and so Miltiades died; and
the fifty talents were paid by his son Cimon.

Now the way in which Miltiades had made himself master of Lemnos
was the following. There were certain Pelasgians whom the Athenians
once drove out of Attica; whether they did it- justly or unjustly I
cannot say, since I only know what is reported concerning it, which is
the following: Hecataeus, the son of Hegesander, says in his History
that it was unjustly. "The Athenians," according to him, "had given to
the Pelasgi a tract of land at the foot of Hymettus as payment for the
wall with which the Pelasgians had surrounded their citadel. This land
was barren, and little worth at the time; but the Pelasgians brought
it into good condition; whereupon the Athenians begrudged them the
tract, and desired to recover it. And so, without any better excuse,
they took arms and drove out the Pelasgians." But the Athenians
maintain that they were justified in what they did. "The
Pelasgians," they say, "while they lived at the foot of Hymettus, were
wont to sally forth from that region and commit outrages on their
children. For the Athenians used at that time to send their sons and
daughters to draw water at the fountain called 'the Nine Springs,'
inasmuch as neither they nor the other Greeks had any household slaves
in those days; and the maidens, whenever they came, were used rudely
and insolently by the Pelasgians. Nor were they even content thus; but
at the last they laid a plot, and were caught by the Athenians in
the act of making an attempt upon their city. Then did the Athenians
give a proof how much better men they were than the Pelasgians; for
whereas they might justly have killed them all, having caught them
in the very act of rebelling, the; spared their lives, and only
required that they should leave the country. Hereupon the Pelasgians
quitted Attica, and settled in Lemnos and other places." Such are
the accounts respectively of Hecataeus and the Athenians.

These same Pelasgians, after they were settled in Lemnos,
conceived the wish to be revenged on the Athenians. So, as they were
well acquainted with the Athenian festivals, they manned some
penteconters, and having laid an ambush to catch the Athenian women as
they kept the festival of Diana at Brauron, they succeeded in carrying
off a large number, whom they took to Lemnos and there kept as
concubines. After a while the women bore children, whom they taught to
speak the language of Attica and observe the manners of the Athenians.
These boys refused to have any commerce with the sons of the Pelasgian
women; and if a Pelasgian boy struck one of their number, they all
made common cause, and joined in avenging their comrade; nay, the
Greek boys even set up a claim to exercise lordship over the others,
and succeeded in gaining the upper hand. When these things came to the
ears of the Pelasgians, they took counsel together, and, on
considering the matter, they grew frightened, and said one to another,
"If these boys even now are resolved to make common cause against
the sons of our lawful wives, and seek to exercise lordship over them,
what may we expect when they grow up to be men?" Then it seemed good
to the Pelasgians to kill all the sons of the Attic women; which
they did accordingly, and at the same time slew likewise their
mothers. From this deed, and that former crime of the Lemnian women,
when they slew their husbands in the days of Thoas, it has come to
be usual throughout Greece to call wicked actions by the name of
"Lemnian deeds."

When the Pelasgians had thus slain their children and their women,
the earth refused to bring forth its fruits for them, and their
wives bore fewer children, and their flocks and herds increased more
slowly than before, till at last, sore pressed by famine and
bereavement, they sent men to Delphi, and begged the god to tell
them how they might obtain deliverance from their sufferings. The
Pythoness answered that "they must give the Athenians whatever
satisfaction they might demand." Then the Pelasgians went to Athens
and declared their wish to give the Athenians satisfaction for the
wrong which they had done to them. So the Athenians had a couch
prepared in their townhall, and adorned it with the fairest coverlets,
and set by its side a table laden with all manner of good things,
and then told the Pelasgians they must deliver up their country to
them in a similar condition. The Pelasgians answered and said, "When a
ship comes with a north wind from your country to ours in a single
day, then will we give it up to you." This they said because they knew
that what they required was impossible, for Attica lies a long way
to the south of Lemnos.

No more passed at that time. But very many years afterwards,
when the Hellespontian Chersonese had been brought under the power
of Athens, Miltiades, the son of Cimon, sailed, during the
prevalence of the Etesian winds, from Elaeus in the Chersonese to
Lemnos, and called on the Pelasgians to quit their island, reminding
them of the prophecy which they had supposed it impossible to
fulfil. The people of Hephaestia obeyed the call; but they of
Myrina, not acknowledging the Chersonese to be any part of Attica,
refused and were besieged and brought over by force. Thus was Lemnos
gained by the Athenians and Miltiades.
