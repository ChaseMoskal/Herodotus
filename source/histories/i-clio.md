THESE are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he
publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the
remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and
wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their
due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds
of feuds.

According to the Persians best informed in history, the
Phoenicians began to quarrel. This people, who had formerly dwelt on
the shores of the Erythraean Sea, having migrated to the Mediterranean
and settled in the parts which they now inhabit, began at once, they
say, to adventure on long voyages, freighting their vessels with the
wares of Egypt and Assyria. They landed at many places on the coast,
and among the rest at Argos, which was then preeminent above all the
states included now under the common name of Hellas. Here they exposed
their merchandise, and traded with the natives for five or six days;
at the end of which time, when almost everything was sold, there
came down to the beach a number of women, and among them the
daughter of the king, who was, they say, agreeing in this with the
Greeks, Io, the child of Inachus. The women were standing by the stern
of the ship intent upon their purchases, when the Phoenicians, with
a general shout, rushed upon them. The greater part made their escape,
but some were seized and carried off. Io herself was among the
captives. The Phoenicians put the women on board their vessel, and set
sail for Egypt. Thus did Io pass into Egypt, according to the
Persian story, which differs widely from the Phoenician: and thus
commenced, according to their authors, the series of outrages.

At a later period, certain Greeks, with whose name they are
unacquainted, but who would probably be Cretans, made a landing at
Tyre, on the Phoenician coast, and bore off the king's daughter,
Europe. In this they only retaliated; but afterwards the Greeks,
they say, were guilty of a second violence. They manned a ship of war,
and sailed to Aea, a city of Colchis, on the river Phasis; from
whence, after despatching the rest of the business on which they had
come, they carried off Medea, the daughter of the king of the land.
The monarch sent a herald into Greece to demand reparation of the
wrong, and the restitution of his child; but the Greeks made answer
that, having received no reparation of the wrong done them in the
seizure of Io the Argive, they should give none in this instance.

In the next generation afterwards, according to the same
authorities, Alexander the son of Priam, bearing these events in mind,
resolved to procure himself a wife out of Greece by violence, fully
persuaded, that as the Greeks had not given satisfaction for their
outrages, so neither would he be forced to make any for his.
Accordingly he made prize of Helen; upon which the Greeks decided
that, before resorting to other measures, they would send envoys to
reclaim the princess and require reparation of the wrong. Their
demands were met by a reference to the violence which had been offered
to Medea, and they were asked with what face they could now require
satisfaction, when they had formerly rejected all demands for either
reparation or restitution addressed to them.

Hitherto the injuries on either side had been mere acts of
common violence; but in what followed the Persians consider that the
Greeks were greatly to blame, since before any attack had been made on
Europe, they led an army into Asia. Now as for the carrying off of
women, it is the deed, they say, of a rogue: but to make a stir
about such as are carried off, argues a man a fool. Men of sense
care nothing for such women, since it is plain that without their
own consent they would never be forced away. The Asiatics, when the
Greeks ran off with their women, never troubled themselves about the
matter; but the Greeks, for the sake of a single Lacedaemonian girl,
collected a vast armament, invaded Asia, and destroyed the kingdom
of Priam. Henceforth they ever looked upon the Greeks as their open
enemies. For Asia, with all the various tribes of barbarians that
inhabit it, is regarded by the Persians as their own; but Europe and
the Greek race they look on as distinct and separate.

Such is the account which the Persians give of these matters. They
trace to the attack upon Troy their ancient enmity towards the Greeks.
The Phoenicians, however, as regards Io, vary from the Persian
statements. They deny that they used any violence to remove her into
Egypt; she herself, they say, having formed an intimacy with the
captain, while his vessel lay at Argos, and perceiving herself to be
with child, of her own free will accompanied the Phoenicians on
their leaving the shore, to escape the shame of detection and the
reproaches of her parents. Whether this latter account be true, or
whether the matter happened otherwise, I shall not discuss further.
I shall proceed at once to point out the person who first within my
own knowledge inflicted injury on the Greeks, after which I shall go
forward with my history, describing equally the greater and the lesser
cities. For the cities which were formerly great have most of them
become insignificant; and such as are at present powerful, were weak
in the olden time. I shall therefore discourse equally of both,
convinced that human happiness never continues long in one stay.

Croesus, son of Alyattes, by birth a Lydian, was lord of all the
nations to the west of the river Halys. This stream, which separates
Syria from Paphlagonia, runs with a course from south to north, and
finally falls into the Euxine. So far as our knowledge goes, he was
the first of the barbarians who had dealings with the Greeks,
forcing some of them to become his tributaries, and entering into
alliance with others. He conquered the Aeolians, Ionians, and
Dorians of Asia, and made a treaty with the Lacedaemonians. Up to that
time all Greeks had been free. For the Cimmerian attack upon Ionia,
which was earlier than Croesus, was not a conquest of the cities,
but only an inroad for plundering.

The sovereignty of Lydia, which had belonged to the Heraclides,
passed into the family of Croesus, who were called the Mermnadae, in
the manner which I will now relate. There was a certain king of
Sardis, Candaules by name, whom the Greeks called Myrsilus. He was a
descendant of Alcaeus, son of Hercules. The first king of this dynasty
was Agron, son of Ninus, grandson of Belus, and great-grandson of
Alcaeus; Candaules, son of Myrsus, was the last. The kings who reigned
before Agron sprang from Lydus, son of Atys, from whom the people of
the land, called previously Meonians, received the name of Lydians.
The Heraclides, descended from Hercules and the slave-girl of
Jardanus, having been entrusted by these princes with the management
of affairs, obtained the kingdom by an oracle. Their rule endured
for two and twenty generations of men, a space of five hundred and
five years; during the whole of which period, from Agron to Candaules,
the crown descended in the direct line from father to son.

Now it happened that this Candaules was in love with his own wife;
and not only so, but thought her the fairest woman in the whole world.
This fancy had strange consequences. There was in his bodyguard a
man whom he specially favoured, Gyges, the son of Dascylus. All
affairs of greatest moment were entrusted by Candaules to this person,
and to him he was wont to extol the surpassing beauty of his wife.
So matters went on for a while. At length, one day, Candaules, who was
fated to end ill, thus addressed his follower: "I see thou dost not
credit what I tell thee of my lady's loveliness; but come now, since
men's ears are less credulous than their eyes, contrive some means
whereby thou mayst behold her naked." At this the other loudly
exclaimed, saying, "What most unwise speech is this, master, which
thou hast uttered? Wouldst thou have me behold my mistress when she is
naked? Bethink thee that a woman, with her clothes, puts off her
bashfulness. Our fathers, in time past, distinguished right and
wrong plainly enough, and it is our wisdom to submit to be taught by
them. There is an old saying, 'Let each look on his own.' I hold thy
wife for the fairest of all womankind. Only, I beseech thee, ask me
not to do wickedly."

Gyges thus endeavoured to decline the king's proposal, trembling
lest some dreadful evil should befall him through it. But the king
replied to him, "Courage, friend; suspect me not of the design to
prove thee by this discourse; nor dread thy mistress, lest mischief
be. thee at her hands. Be sure I will so manage that she shall not
even know that thou hast looked upon her. I will place thee behind the
open door of the chamber in which we sleep. When I enter to go to rest
she will follow me. There stands a chair close to the entrance, on
which she will lay her clothes one by one as she takes them off.
Thou wilt be able thus at thy leisure to peruse her person. Then, when
she is moving from the chair toward the bed, and her back is turned on
thee, be it thy care that she see thee not as thou passest through the
doorway."

Gyges, unable to escape, could but declare his readiness. Then
Candaules, when bedtime came, led Gyges into his sleeping-chamber, and
a moment after the queen followed. She entered, and laid her
garments on the chair, and Gyges gazed on her. After a while she moved
toward the bed, and her back being then turned, he glided stealthily
from the apartment. As he was passing out, however, she saw him, and
instantly divining what had happened, she neither screamed as her
shame impelled her, nor even appeared to have noticed aught, purposing
to take vengeance upon the husband who had so affronted her. For among
the Lydians, and indeed among the barbarians generally, it is reckoned
a deep disgrace, even to a man, to be seen naked.

No sound or sign of intelligence escaped her at the time. But in
the morning, as soon as day broke, she hastened to choose from among
her retinue such as she knew to be most faithful to her, and preparing
them for what was to ensue, summoned Gyges into her presence. Now it
had often happened before that the queen had desired to confer with
him, and he was accustomed to come to her at her call. He therefore
obeyed the summons, not suspecting that she knew aught of what had
occurred. Then she addressed these words to him: "Take thy choice,
Gyges, of two courses which are open to thee. Slay Candaules, and
thereby become my lord, and obtain the Lydian throne, or die this
moment in his room. So wilt thou not again, obeying all behests of thy
master, behold what is not lawful for thee. It must needs be that
either he perish by whose counsel this thing was done, or thou, who
sawest me naked, and so didst break our usages." At these words
Gyges stood awhile in mute astonishment; recovering after a time, he
earnestly besought the queen that she would not compel him to so
hard a choice. But finding he implored in vain, and that necessity was
indeed laid on him to kill or to be killed, he made choice of life for
himself, and replied by this inquiry: "If it must be so, and thou
compellest me against my will to put my lord to death, come, let me
hear how thou wilt have me set on him." "Let him be attacked," she
answered, "on the spot where I was by him shown naked to you, and
let the assault be made when he is asleep."

All was then prepared for the attack, and when night fell,
Gyges, seeing that he had no retreat or escape, but must absolutely
either slay Candaules, or himself be slain, followed his mistress into
the sleeping-room. She placed a dagger in his hand and hid him
carefully behind the self-same door. Then Gyges, when the king was
fallen asleep, entered privily into the chamber and struck him dead.
Thus did the wife and kingdom of Candaules pass into the possession of
Gyges, of whom Archilochus the Parian, who lived about the same
time, made mention in a poem written in iambic trimeter verse.

Gyges was afterwards confirmed in the possession of the throne
by an answer of the Delphic oracle. Enraged at the murder of their
king, the people flew to arms, but after a while the partisans of
Gyges came to terms with them, and it was agreed that if the Delphic
oracle declared him king of the Lydians, he should reign; if
otherwise, he should yield the throne to the Heraclides. As the oracle
was given in his favour he became king. The Pythoness, however,
added that, in the fifth generation from Gyges, vengeance should
come for the Heraclides; a prophecy of which neither the Lydians nor
their princes took any account till it was fulfilled. Such was the way
in which the Mermnadae deposed the Heraclides, and themselves obtained
the sovereignty.

When Gyges was established on the throne, he sent no small
presents to Delphi, as his many silver offerings at the Delphic shrine
testify. Besides this silver he gave a vast number of vessels of gold,
among which the most worthy of mention are the goblets, six in number,
and weighing altogether thirty talents, which stand in the
Corinthian treasury, dedicated by him. I call it the Corinthian
treasury, though in strictness of speech it is the treasury not of the
whole Corinthian people, but of Cypselus, son of Eetion. Excepting
Midas, son of Gordias, king of Phrygia, Gyges was the first of the
barbarians whom we know to have sent offerings to Delphi. Midas
dedicated the royal throne whereon he was accustomed to sit and
administer justice, an object well worth looking at. It lies in the
same place as the goblets presented by Gyges. The Delphians call the
whole of the silver and the gold which Gyges dedicated, after the name
of the donor, Gygian.

As soon as Gyges was king he made an in-road on Miletus and
Smyrna, and took the city of Colophon. Afterwards, however, though
he reigned eight and thirty years, he did not perform a single noble
exploit. I shall therefore make no further mention of him, but pass on
to his son and successor in the kingdom, Ardys.

Ardys took Priene and made war upon Miletus. In his reign the
Cimmerians, driven from their homes by the nomads of Scythia,
entered Asia and captured Sardis, all but the citadel. He reigned
forty-nine years, and was succeeded by his son, Sadyattes, who reigned
twelve years. At his death his son Alyattes mounted the throne.

This prince waged war with the Medes under Cyaxares, the
grandson of Deioces, drove the Cimmerians out of Asia, conquered
Smyrna, the Colophonian colony, and invaded Clazomenae. From this last
contest he did not come off as he could have wished, but met with a
sore defeat; still, however, in the course of his reign, he
performed other actions very worthy of note, of which I will now
proceed to give an account.

Inheriting from his father a war with the Milesians, he pressed
the siege against the city by attacking it in the following manner.
When the harvest was ripe on the ground he marched his army into
Milesia to the sound of pipes and harps, and flutes masculine and
feminine. The buildings that were scattered over the country he
neither pulled down nor burnt, nor did he even tear away the doors,
but left them standing as they were. He cut down, however, and utterly
destroyed all the trees and all the corn throughout the land, and then
returned to his own dominions. It was idle for his army to sit down
before the place, as the Milesians were masters of the sea. The reason
that he did not demolish their buildings was that the inhabitants
might be tempted to use them as homesteads from which to go forth to
sow and till their lands; and so each time that he invaded the country
he might find something to plunder.

In this way he carried on the war with the Milesians for eleven
years, in the course of which he inflicted on them two terrible blows;
one in their own country in the district of Limeneium, the other in
the plain of the Maeander. During six of these eleven years,
Sadyattes, the son of Ardys who first lighted the flames of this
war, was king of Lydia, and made the incursions. Only the five
following years belong to the reign of Alyattes, son of Sadyattes, who
(as I said before) inheriting the war from his father, applied himself
to it unremittingly. The Milesians throughout the contest received
no help at all from any of the Ionians, excepting those of Chios,
who lent them troops in requital of a like service rendered them in
former times, the Milesians having fought on the side of the Chians
during the whole of the war between them and the people of Erythrae.

It was in the twelfth year of the war that the following mischance
occurred from the firing of the harvest-fields. Scarcely had the
corn been set alight by the soldiers when a violent wind carried the
flames against the temple of Minerva Assesia, which caught fire and
was burnt to the ground. At the time no one made any account of the
circumstance; but afterwards, on the return of the army to Sardis,
Alyattes fell sick. His illness continued, whereupon, either advised
thereto by some friend, or perchance himself conceiving the idea, he
sent messengers to Delphi to inquire of the god concerning his malady.
On their arrival the Pythoness declared that no answer should be given
them until they had rebuilt the temple of Minerva, burnt by the
Lydians at Assesus in Milesia.

Thus much I know from information given me by the Delphians; the
remainder of the story the Milesians add.

The answer made by the oracle came to the ears of Periander, son
of Cypselus, who was a very close friend to Thrasybulus, tyrant of
Miletus at that period. He instantly despatched a messenger to
report the oracle to him, in order that Thrasybulus, forewarned of its
tenor, might the better adapt his measures to the posture of affairs.

Alyattes, the moment that the words of the oracle were reported to
him, sent a herald to Miletus in hopes of concluding a truce with
Thrasybulus and the Milesians for such a time as was needed to rebuild
the temple. The herald went upon his way; but meantime Thrasybulus had
been apprised of everything; and conjecturing what Alyattes would
do, he contrived this artifice. He had all the corn that was in the
city, whether belonging to himself or to private persons, brought into
the market-place, and issued an order that the Milesians should hold
themselves in readiness, and, when he gave the signal, should, one and
all, fall to drinking and revelry.

The purpose for which he gave these orders was the following. He
hoped that the Sardian herald, seeing so great store of corn upon
the ground, and all the city given up to festivity, would inform
Alyattes of it, which fell out as he anticipated. The herald
observed the whole, and when he had delivered his message, went back
to Sardis. This circumstance alone, as I gather, brought about the
peace which ensued. Alyattes, who had hoped that there was now a great
scarcity of corn in Miletus, and that the people were worn down to the
last pitch of suffering, when he heard from the herald on his return
from Miletus tidings so contrary to those he had expected, made a
treaty with the enemy by which the two nations became close friends
and allies. He then built at Assesus two temples to Minerva instead of
one, and shortly after recovered from his malady. Such were the
chief circumstances of the war which Alyattes waged with Thrasybulus
and the Milesians.

This Periander, who apprised Thrasybulus of the oracle, was son of
Cypselus, and tyrant of Corinth. In his time a very wonderful thing is
said to have happened. The Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their
account of the matter. They relate that Arion of Methymna, who as a
player on the harp, was second to no man living at that time, and
who was, so far as we know, the first to invent the dithyrambic
measure, to give it its name, and to recite in it at Corinth, was
carried to Taenarum on the back of a dolphin.

He had lived for many years at the court of Periander, when a
longing came upon him to sail across to Italy and Sicily. Having
made rich profits in those parts, he wanted to recross the seas to
Corinth. He therefore hired a vessel, the crew of which were
Corinthians, thinking that there was no people in whom he could more
safely confide; and, going on board, he set sail from Tarentum. The
sailors, however, when they reached the open sea, formed a plot to
throw him overboard and seize upon his riches. Discovering their
design, he fell on his knees, beseeching them to spare his life, and
making them welcome to his money. But they refused; and required him
either to kill himself outright, if he wished for a grave on the dry
land, or without loss of time to leap overboard into the sea. In
this strait Arion begged them, since such was their pleasure, to allow
him to mount upon the quarter-deck, dressed in his full costume, and
there to play and sing, and promising that, as soon as his song was
ended, he would destroy himself. Delighted at the prospect of
hearing the very best harper in the world, they consented, and
withdrew from the stern to the middle of the vessel: while Arion
dressed himself in the full costume of his calling, took his harp, and
standing on the quarter-deck, chanted the Orthian. His strain ended,
he flung himself, fully attired as he was, headlong into the sea.
The Corinthians then sailed on to Corinth. As for Arion, a dolphin,
they say, took him upon his back and carried him to Taenarum, where he
went ashore, and thence proceeded to Corinth in his musician's
dress, and told all that had happened to him. Periander, however,
disbelieved the story, and put Arion in ward, to prevent his leaving
Corinth, while he watched anxiously for the return of the mariners. On
their arrival he summoned them before him and asked them if they could
give him any tiding of Arion. They returned for answer that he was
alive and in good health in Italy, and that they had left him at
Tarentum, where he was doing well. Thereupon Arion appeared before
them, just as he was when he jumped from the vessel: the men,
astonished and detected in falsehood, could no longer deny their
guilt. Such is the account which the Corinthians and Lesbians give;
and there is to this day at Taenarum, an offering of Arion's at the
shrine, which is a small figure in bronze, representing a man seated
upon a dolphin.

Having brought the war with the Milesians to a close, and
reigned over the land of Lydia for fifty-seven years, Alyattes died.
He was the second prince of his house who made offerings at Delphi.
His gifts, which he sent on recovering from his sickness, were a great
bowl of pure silver, with a salver in steel curiously inlaid, a work
among all the offerings at Delphi the best worth looking at.
Glaucus, the Chian, made it, the man who first invented the art of
inlaying steel.

On the death of Alyattes, Croesus, his son, who was thirty-five
years old, succeeded to the throne. Of the Greek cities, Ephesus was
the first that he attacked. The Ephesians, when he laid siege to the
place, made an offering of their city to Diana, by stretching a rope
from the town wall to the temple of the goddess, which was distant
from the ancient city, then besieged by Croesus, a space of seven
furlongs. They were, as I said, the first Greeks whom he attacked.
Afterwards, on some pretext or other, he made war in turn upon every
Ionian and Aeolian state, bringing forward, where he could, a
substantial ground of complaint; where such failed him, advancing some
poor excuse.

In this way he made himself master of all the Greek cities in
Asia, and forced them to become his tributaries; after which he
began to think of building ships, and attacking the islanders.
Everything had been got ready for this purpose, when Bias of Priene
(or, as some say, Pittacus the Mytilenean) put a stop to the
project. The king had made inquiry of this person, who was lately
arrived at Sardis, if there were any news from Greece; to which he
answered, "Yes, sire, the islanders are gathering ten thousand
horse, designing an expedition against thee and against thy
capital." Croesus, thinking he spake seriously, broke out, "Ah,
might the gods put such a thought into their minds as to attack the
sons of the Lydians with cavalry!" "It seems, oh! king," rejoined
the other, "that thou desirest earnestly to catch the islanders on
horseback upon the mainland,- thou knowest well what would come of it.
But what thinkest thou the islanders desire better, now that they hear
thou art about to build ships and sail against them, than to catch the
Lydians at sea, and there revenge on them the wrongs of their brothers
upon the mainland, whom thou holdest in slavery?" Croesus was
charmed with the turn of the speech; and thinking there was reason
in what was said, gave up his ship-building and concluded a league
of amity with the Ionians of the isles.

Croesus afterwards, in the course of many years, brought under his
sway almost all the nations to the west of the Halys. The Lycians
and Cilicians alone continued free; all the other tribes he reduced
and held in subjection. They were the following: the Lydians,
Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandynians, Chalybians, Paphlagonians,
Thynian and Bithynian Thracians, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians
and Pamphylians.

When all these conquests had been added to the Lydian empire,
and the prosperity of Sardis was now at its height, there came
thither, one after another, all the sages of Greece living at the
time, and among them Solon, the Athenian. He was on his travels,
having left Athens to be absent ten years, under the pretence of
wishing to see the world, but really to avoid being forced to repeal
any of the laws which, at the request of the Athenians, he had made
for them. Without his sanction the Athenians could not repeal them, as
they had bound themselves under a heavy curse to be governed for ten
years by the laws which should be imposed on them by Solon.

On this account, as well as to see the world, Solon set out upon
his travels, in the course of which he went to Egypt to the court of
Amasis, and also came on a visit to Croesus at Sardis. Croesus
received him as his guest, and lodged him in the royal palace. On
the third or fourth day after, he bade his servants conduct Solon.
over his treasuries, and show him all their greatness and
magnificence. When he had seen them all, and, so far as time
allowed, inspected them, Croesus addressed this question to him.
"Stranger of Athens, we have heard much of thy wisdom and of thy
travels through many lands, from love of knowledge and a wish to see
the world. I am curious therefore to inquire of thee, whom, of all the
men that thou hast seen, thou deemest the most happy?" This he asked
because he thought himself the happiest of mortals: but Solon answered
him without flattery, according to his true sentiments, "Tellus of
Athens, sire." Full of astonishment at what he heard, Croesus demanded
sharply, "And wherefore dost thou deem Tellus happiest?" To which
the other replied, "First, because his country was flourishing in
his days, and he himself had sons both beautiful and good, and he
lived to see children born to each of them, and these children all
grew up; and further because, after a life spent in what our people
look upon as comfort, his end was surpassingly glorious. In a battle
between the Athenians and their neighbours near Eleusis, he came to
the assistance of his countrymen, routed the foe, and died upon the
field most gallantly. The Athenians gave him a public funeral on the
spot where he fell, and paid him the highest honours."

Thus did Solon admonish Croesus by the example of Tellus,
enumerating the manifold particulars of his happiness. When he had
ended, Croesus inquired a second time, who after Tellus seemed to
him the happiest, expecting that at any rate, he would be given the
second place. "Cleobis and Bito," Solon answered; "they were of Argive
race; their fortune was enough for their wants, and they were
besides endowed with so much bodily strength that they had both gained
prizes at the Games. Also this tale is told of them:- There was a
great festival in honour of the goddess Juno at Argos, to which
their mother must needs be taken in a car. Now the oxen did not come
home from the field in time: so the youths, fearful of being too late,
put the yoke on their own necks, and themselves drew the car in
which their mother rode. Five and forty furlongs did they draw her,
and stopped before the temple. This deed of theirs was witnessed by
the whole assembly of worshippers, and then their life closed in the
best possible way. Herein, too, God showed forth most evidently, how
much better a thing for man death is than life. For the Argive men,
who stood around the car, extolled the vast strength of the youths;
and the Argive women extolled the mother who was blessed with such a
pair of sons; and the mother herself, overjoyed at the deed and at the
praises it had won, standing straight before the image, besought the
goddess to bestow on Cleobis and Bito, the sons who had so mightily
honoured her, the highest blessing to which mortals can attain. Her
prayer ended, they offered sacrifice and partook of the holy
banquet, after which the two youths fell asleep in the temple. They
never woke more, but so passed from the earth. The Argives, looking on
them as among the best of men, caused statues of them to be made,
which they gave to the shrine at Delphi."

When Solon had thus assigned these youths the second place,
Croesus broke in angrily, "What, stranger of Athens, is my
happiness, then, so utterly set at nought by thee, that thou dost
not even put me on a level with private men?"

"Oh! Croesus," replied the other, "thou askedst a question
concerning the condition of man, of one who knows that the power above
us is full of jealousy, and fond of troubling our lot. A long life
gives one to witness much, and experience much oneself, that one would
not choose. Seventy years I regard as the limit of the life of man. In
these seventy years are contained, without reckoning intercalary
months, twenty-five thousand and two hundred days. Add an
intercalary month to every other year, that the seasons may come round
at the right time, and there will be, besides the seventy years,
thirty-five such months, making an addition of one thousand and
fifty days. The whole number of the days contained in the seventy
years will thus be twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty,
whereof not one but will produce events unlike the rest. Hence man
is wholly accident. For thyself, oh! Croesus, I see that thou art
wonderfully rich, and art the lord of many nations; but with respect
to that whereon thou questionest me, I have no answer to give, until I
hear that thou hast closed thy life happily. For assuredly he who
possesses great store of riches is no nearer happiness than he who has
what suffices for his daily needs, unless it so hap that luck attend
upon him, and so he continue in the enjoyment of all his good things
to the end of life. For many of the wealthiest men have been
unfavoured of fortune, and many whose means were moderate have had
excellent luck. Men of the former class excel those of the latter
but in two respects; these last excel the former in many. The
wealthy man is better able to content his desires, and to bear up
against a sudden buffet of calamity. The other has less ability to
withstand these evils (from which, however, his good luck keeps him
clear), but he enjoys all these following blessings: he is whole of
limb, a stranger to disease, free from misfortune, happy in his
children, and comely to look upon. If, in addition to all this, he end
his life well, he is of a truth the man of whom thou art in search,
the man who may rightly be termed happy. Call him, however, until he
die, not happy but fortunate. Scarcely, indeed, can any man unite
all these advantages: as there is no country which contains within
it all that it needs, but each, while it possesses some things,
lacks others, and the best country is that which contains the most; so
no single human being is complete in every respect- something is
always lacking. He who unites the greatest number of advantages, and
retaining them to the day of his death, then dies peaceably, that
man alone, sire, is, in my judgment, entitled to bear the name of
'happy.' But in every matter it behoves us to mark well the end: for
oftentimes God gives men a gleam of happiness, and then plunges them
into ruin."

Such was the speech which Solon addressed to Croesus, a speech
which brought him neither largess nor honour. The king saw him
depart with much indifference, since he thought that a man must be
an arrant fool who made no account of present good, but bade men
always wait and mark the end.

After Solon had gone away a dreadful vengeance, sent of God,
came upon Croesus, to punish him, it is likely, for deeming himself
the happiest of men. First he had a dream in the night, which
foreshowed him truly the evils that were about to befall him in the
person of his son. For Croesus had two sons, one blasted by a
natural defect, being deaf and dumb; the other, distinguished far
above all his co-mates in every pursuit. The name of the last was
Atys. It was this son concerning whom he dreamt a dream that he
would die by the blow of an iron weapon. When he woke, he considered
earnestly with himself, and, greatly alarmed at the dream, instantly
made his son take a wife, and whereas in former years the youth had
been wont to command the Lydian forces in the field, he now would
not suffer him to accompany them. All the spears and javelins, and
weapons used in the wars, he removed out of the male apartments, and
laid them in heaps in the chambers of the women, fearing lest
perhaps one of the weapons that hung against the wall might fall and
strike him.

Now it chanced that while he was making arrangements for the
wedding, there came to Sardis a man under a misfortune, who had upon
him the stain of blood. He was by race a Phrygian, and belonged to the
family of the king. Presenting himself at the palace of Croesus, he
prayed to be admitted to purification according to the customs of
the country. Now the Lydian method of purifying is very nearly the
same as the Greek. Croesus granted the request, and went through all
the customary rites, after which he asked the suppliant of his birth
and country, addressing him as follows:- "Who art thou, stranger,
and from what part of Phrygia fleddest thou to take refuge at my
hearth? And whom, moreover, what man or what woman, hast thou
slain?" "Oh! king," replied the Phrygian, "I am the son of Gordias,
son of Midas. I am named Adrastus. The man I unintentionally slew
was my own brother. For this my father drove me from the land, and I
lost all. Then fled I here to thee." "Thou art the offspring," Croesus
rejoined, "of a house friendly to mine, and thou art come to
friends. Thou shalt want for nothing so long as thou abidest in my
dominions. Bear thy misfortune as easily as thou mayest, so will it go
best with thee." Thenceforth Adrastus lived in the palace of the king.

It chanced that at this very same time there was in the Mysian
Olympus a huge monster of a boar, which went forth often from this
mountain country, and wasted the corn-fields of the Mysians. Many a
time had the Mysians collected to hunt the beast, but instead of doing
him any hurt, they came off always with some loss to themselves. At
length they sent ambassadors to Croesus, who delivered their message
to him in these words: "Oh! king, a mighty monster of a boar has
appeared in our parts, and destroys the labour of our hands. We do our
best to take him, but in vain. Now therefore we beseech thee to let
thy son accompany us back, with some chosen youths and hounds, that we
may rid our country of the animal." Such was the tenor of their
prayer.

But Croesus bethought him of his dream, and answered, "Say no more
of my son going with you; that may not be in any wise. He is but
just joined in wedlock, and is busy enough with that. I will grant you
a picked band of Lydians, and all my huntsmen and hounds; and I will
charge those whom I send to use all zeal in aiding you to rid your
country of the brute."

With this reply the Mysians were content; but the king's son,
hearing what the prayer of the Mysians was, came suddenly in, and on
the refusal of Croesus to let him go with them, thus addressed his
father: "Formerly, my father, it was deemed the noblest and most
suitable thing for me to frequent the wars and hunting-parties, and
win myself glory in them; but now thou keepest me away from both,
although thou hast never beheld in me either cowardice or lack of
spirit. What face meanwhile must I wear as I walk to the forum or
return from it? What must the citizens, what must my young bride think
of me? What sort of man will she suppose her husband to be? Either,
therefore, let me go to the chase of this boar, or give me a reason
why it is best for me to do according to thy wishes."

Then Croesus answered, "My son, it is not because I have seen in
thee either cowardice or aught else which has displeased me that I
keep thee back; but because a vision which came before me in a dream
as I slept, warned me that thou wert doomed to die young, pierced by
an iron weapon. It was this which first led me to hasten on thy
wedding, and now it hinders me from sending thee upon this enterprise.
Fain would I keep watch over thee, if by any means I may cheat fate of
thee during my own lifetime. For thou art the one and only son that
I possess; the other, whose hearing is destroyed, I regard as if he
were not."

"Ah! father," returned the youth, "I blame thee not for keeping
watch over me after a dream so terrible; but if thou mistakest, if
thou dost not apprehend the dream aright, 'tis no blame for me to show
thee wherein thou errest. Now the dream, thou saidst thyself, foretold
that I should die stricken by an iron weapon. But what hands has a
boar to strike with? What iron weapon does he wield? Yet this is
what thou fearest for me. Had the dream said that I should die pierced
by a tusk, then thou hadst done well to keep me away; but it said a
weapon. Now here we do not combat men, but a wild animal. I pray thee,
therefore, let me go with them."

"There thou hast me, my son," said Croesus, "thy interpretation is
better than mine. I yield to it, and change my mind, and consent to
let thee go."

Then the king sent for Adrastus, the Phrygian, and said to him,
"Adrastus, when thou wert smitten with the rod of affliction- no
reproach, my friend- I purified thee, and have taken thee to live with
me in my palace, and have been at every charge. Now, therefore, it
behoves thee to requite the good offices which thou hast received at
my hands by consenting to go with my son on this hunting party, and to
watch over him, if perchance you should be attacked upon the road by
some band of daring robbers. Even apart from this, it were right for
thee to go where thou mayest make thyself famous by noble deeds.
They are the heritage of thy family, and thou too art so stalwart
and strong."

Adrastus answered, "Except for thy request, Oh! king, I would
rather have kept away from this hunt; for methinks it ill beseems a
man under a misfortune such as mine to consort with his happier
compeers; and besides, I have no heart to it. On many grounds I had
stayed behind; but, as thou urgest it, and I am bound to pleasure thee
(for truly it does behove me to requite thy good offices), I am
content to do as thou wishest. For thy son, whom thou givest into my
charge, be sure thou shalt receive him back safe and sound, so far
as depends upon a guardian's carefulness."

Thus assured, Croesus let them depart, accompanied by a band of
picked youths, and well provided with dogs of chase. When they reached
Olympus, they scattered in quest of the animal; he was soon found, and
the hunters, drawing round him in a circle, hurled their weapons at
him. Then the stranger, the man who had been purified of blood,
whose name was Adrastus, he also hurled his spear at the boar, but
missed his aim, and struck Atys. Thus was the son of Croesus slain
by the point of an iron weapon, and the warning of the vision was
fulfilled. Then one ran to Sardis to bear the tidings to the king, and
he came and informed him of the combat and of the fate that had
befallen his son.

If it was a heavy blow to the father to learn that his child was
dead, it yet more strongly affected him to think that the very man
whom he himself once purified had done the deed. In the violence of
his grief he called aloud on Jupiter Catharsius to be a witness of
what he had suffered at the stranger's hands. Afterwards he invoked
the same god as Jupiter Ephistius and Hetaereus- using the one term
because he had unwittingly harboured in his house the man who had
now slain his son; and the other, because the stranger, who had been
sent as his child's guardian, had turned out his most cruel enemy.

Presently the Lydians arrived, bearing the body of the youth,
and behind them followed the homicide. He took his stand in front of
the corse, and, stretching forth his hands to Croesus, delivered
himself into his power with earnest entreaties that he would sacrifice
him upon the body of his son- "his former misfortune was burthen
enough; now that he had added to it a second, and had brought ruin
on the man who purified him, he could not bear to live." Then Croesus,
when he heard these words, was moved with pity towards Adrastus,
notwithstanding the bitterness of his own calamity; and so he
answered, "Enough, my friend; I have all the revenge that I require,
since thou givest sentence of death against thyself. But in sooth it
is not thou who hast injured me, except so far as thou hast
unwittingly dealt the blow. Some god is the author of my misfortune,
and I was forewarned of it a long time ago." Croesus after this buried
the body of his son, with such honours as befitted the occasion.
Adrastus, son of Gordias, son of Midas, the destroyer of his brother
in time past, the destroyer now of his purifier, regarding himself
as the most unfortunate wretch whom he had ever known, so soon as
all was quiet about the place, slew himself upon the tomb. Croesus,
bereft of his son, gave himself up to mourning for two full years.

At the end of this time the grief of Croesus was interrupted by
intelligence from abroad. He learnt that Cyrus, the son of Cambyses,
had destroyed the empire of Astyages, the son of Cyaxares; and that
the Persians were becoming daily more powerful. This led him to
consider with himself whether it were possible to check the growing
power of that people before it came to a head. With this design he
resolved to make instant trial of the several oracles in Greece, and
of the one in Libya. So he sent his messengers in different
directions, some to Delphi, some to Abae in Phocis, and some to
Dodona; others to the oracle of Amphiaraus; others to that of
Trophonius; others, again, to Branchidae in Milesia. These were the
Greek oracles which he consulted. To Libya he sent another embassy, to
consult the oracle of Ammon. These messengers were sent to test the
knowledge of the oracles, that, if they were found really to return
true answers, he might send a second time, and inquire if he ought
to attack the Persians.

The messengers who were despatched to make trial of the oracles
were given the following instructions: they were to keep count of
the days from the time of their leaving Sardis, and, reckoning from
that date, on the hundredth day they were to consult the oracles,
and to inquire of them what Croesus the son of Alyattes, king of
Lydia, was doing at that moment. The answers given them were to be
taken down in writing, and brought back to him. None of the replies
remain on record except that of the oracle at Delphi. There, the
moment that the Lydians entered the sanctuary, and before they put
their questions, the Pythoness thus answered them in hexameter verse:-

> I can count the sands, and I can measure the ocean;  
> I have ears for the silent, and know what the dumb man meaneth;  
> Lo! on my sense there striketh the smell of a shell-covered
  tortoise,  
> Boiling now on a fire, with the flesh of a lamb, in a cauldron-  
> Brass is the vessel below, and brass the cover above it.

These words the Lydians wrote down at the mouth of the Pythoness
as she prophesied, and then set off on their return to Sardis. When
all the messengers had come back with the answers which they had
received, Croesus undid the rolls, and read what was written in
each. Only one approved itself to him, that of the Delphic oracle.
This he had no sooner heard than he instantly made an act of
adoration, and accepted it as true, declaring that the Delphic was the
only really oracular shrine, the only one that had discovered in
what way he was in fact employed. For on the departure of his
messengers he had set himself to think what was most impossible for
any one to conceive of his doing, and then, waiting till the day
agreed on came, he acted as he had determined. He took a tortoise
and a lamb, and cutting them in pieces with his own hands, boiled them
both together in a brazen cauldron, covered over with a lid which
was also of brass.

Such then was the answer returned to Croesus from Delphi. What the
answer was which the Lydians who went to the shrine of Amphiarans
and performed the customary rites obtained of the oracle there, I have
it not in my power to mention, for there is no record of it. All
that is known is that Croesus believed himself to have found there
also an oracle which spoke the truth.

After this Croesus, having resolved to propitiate the Delphic
god with a magnificent sacrifice, offered up three thousand of every
kind of sacrificial beast, and besides made a huge pile, and placed
upon it couches coated with silver and with gold, and golden
goblets, and robes and vests of purple; all which he burnt in the hope
of thereby making himself more secure of the favour of the god.
Further he issued his orders to all the people of the land to offer
a sacrifice according to their means. When the sacrifice was ended,
the king melted down a vast quantity of gold, and ran it into
ingots, making them six palms long, three palms broad, and one palm in
thickness. The number of ingots was a hundred and seventeen, four
being of refined gold, in weight two talents and a half; the others of
pale gold, and in weight two talents. He also caused a statue of a
lion to be made in refined gold, the weight of which was ten
talents. At the time when the temple of Delphi was burnt to the
ground, this lion fell from the ingots on which it was placed; it
now stands in the Corinthian treasury, and weighs only six talents and
a half, having lost three talents and a half by the fire.

On the completion of these works Croesus sent them away to Delphi,
and with them two bowls of an enormous size, one of gold, the other of
silver, which used to stand, the latter upon the right, the former
upon the left, as one entered the temple. They too were moved at the
time of the fire; and now the golden one is in the Clazomenian
treasury, and weighs eight talents and forty-two minae; the silver one
stands in the corner of the ante-chapel, and holds six hundred
amphorae. This is known because the Delphians fill it at the time of
the Theophania. It is said by the Delphians to be a work of Theodore
the Samian, and I think that they say true, for assuredly it is the
work of no common artist. Croesus sent also four silver casks, which
are in the Corinthian treasury, and two lustral vases, a golden and
a silver one. On the former is inscribed the name of the
Lacedaemonians, and they claim it as a gift of theirs, but wrongly,
since it was really given by Croesus. The inscription upon it was
cut by a Delphian, who wished to pleasure the Lacedaemonians. His name
is known to me, but I forbear to mention it. The boy, through whose
hand the water runs, is (I confess) a Lacedaemonian gift, but they did
not give either of the lustral vases. Besides these various offerings,
Croesus sent to Delphi many others of less account, among the rest a
number of round silver basins. Also he dedicated a female figure in
gold, three cubits high, which is said by the Delphians to be the
statue of his baking-woman; and further, he presented the necklace and
the girdles of his wife.

These were the offerings sent by Croesus to Delphi. To the
shrine of Amphiaraus, with whose valour and misfortune he was
acquainted, he sent a shield entirely of gold, and a spear, also of
solid gold, both head and shaft. They were still existing in my day at
Thebes, laid up in the temple of Ismenian Apollo.

The messengers who had the charge of conveying these treasures
to the shrines, received instructions to ask the oracles whether
Croesus should go to war with the Persians and if so, whether he
should strengthen himself by the forces of an ally. Accordingly,
when they had reached their destinations and presented the gifts, they
proceeded to consult the oracles in the following terms:- "Croesus, of
Lydia and other countries, believing that these are the only real
oracles in all the world, has sent you such presents as your
discoveries deserved, and now inquires of you whether he shall go to
war with the Persians, and if so, whether he shall strengthen
himself by the forces of a confederate." Both the oracles agreed in
the tenor of their reply, which was in each case a prophecy that if
Croesus attacked the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire, and a
recommendation to him to look and see who were the most powerful of
the Greeks, and to make alliance with them.

At the receipt of these oracular replies Croesus was overjoyed,
and feeling sure now that he would destroy the empire of the Persians,
he sent once more to Pytho, and presented to the Delphians, the number
of whom he had ascertained, two gold staters apiece. In return for
this the Delphians granted to Croesus and the Lydians the privilege of
precedency in consulting the oracle, exemption from all charges, the
most honourable seat at the festivals, and the perpetual right of
becoming at pleasure citizens of their town.

After sending these presents to the Delphians, Croesus a third
time consulted the oracle, for having once proved its truthfulness, he
wished to make constant use of it. The question whereto he now desired
an answer was- "Whether his kingdom would be of long duration?" The
following was the reply of the Pythoness:-

> Wait till the time shall come when a mule is monarch of Media;  
> Then, thou delicate Lydian, away to the pebbles of Hermus;  
> Haste, oh! haste thee away, nor blush to behave like a coward.

Of all the answers that had reached him, this pleased him far
the best, for it seemed incredible that a mule should ever come to
be king of the Medes, and so he concluded that the sovereignty would
never depart from himself or his seed after him. Afterwards he
turned his thoughts to the alliance which he had been recommended to
contract, and sought to ascertain by inquiry which was the most
powerful of the Grecian states. His inquiries pointed out to him two
states as pre-eminent above the rest. These were the Lacedaemonians
and the Athenians, the former of Doric, the latter of Ionic blood. And
indeed these two nations had held from very, early times the most
distinguished place in Greece, the being a Pelasgic, the other a
Hellenic people, and the one having never quitted its original
seats, while the other had been excessively migratory; for during
the reign of Deucalion, Phthiotis was the country in which the
Hellenes dwelt, but under Dorus, the son of Hellen, they moved to
the tract at the base of Ossa and Olympus, which is called
Histiaeotis; forced to retire from that region by the Cadmeians,
they settled, under the name of Macedni, in the chain of Pindus. Hence
they once more removed and came to Dryopis; and from Dryopis having
entered the Peloponnese in this way, they became known as Dorians.

What the language of the Pelasgi was I cannot say with any
certainty. If, however, we may form a conjecture from the tongue
spoken by the Pelasgi of the present day- those, for instance, who
live at Creston above the Tyrrhenians, who formerly dwelt in the
district named Thessaliotis, and were neighbours of the people now
called the Dorians- or those again who founded Placia and Scylace upon
the Hellespont, who had previously dwelt for some time with the
Athenians- or those, in short, of any other of the cities which have
dropped the name but are in fact Pelasgian; if, I say, we are to
form a conjecture from any of these, we must pronounce that the
Pelasgi spoke a barbarous language. If this were really so, and the
entire Pelasgic race spoke the same tongue, the Athenians, who were
certainly Pelasgi, must have changed their language at the same time
that they passed into the Hellenic body; for it is a certain fact that
the people of Creston speak a language unlike any of their neighbours,
and the same is true of the Placianians, while the language spoken
by these two people is the same; which shows that they both retain the
idiom which they brought with them into the countries where they are
now settled.

The Hellenic race has never, since its first origin, changed its
speech. This at least seems evident to me. It was a branch of the
Pelasgic, which separated from the main body, and at first was
scanty in numbers and of little power; but it gradually spread and
increased to a multitude of nations, chiefly by the voluntary entrance
into its ranks of numerous tribes of barbarians. The Pelasgi, on the
other hand, were, as I think, a barbarian race which never greatly
multiplied.

On inquiring into the condition of these two nations, Croesus
found that one, the Athenian, was in a state of grievous oppression
and distraction under Pisistratus, the son of Hippocrates, who was
at that time tyrant of Athens. Hippocrates, when he was a private
citizen, is said to have gone once upon a time to Olympia to see the
Games, when a wonderful prodigy happened to him. As he was employed in
sacrificing, the cauldrons which stood near, full of water and of
the flesh of the victims, began to boil without the help of fire, so
that the water overflowed the pots. Chilon the Lacedaemonian, who
happened to be there and to witness the prodigy, advised
Hippocrates, if he were unmarried, never to take into his house a wife
who could bear him a child; if he already had one, to send her back to
her friends; if he had a son, to disown him. Chilon's advice did not
at all please Hippocrates, who disregarded it, and some time after
became the father of Pisistratus. This Pisistratus, at a time when
there was civil contention in Attica between the party of the
Sea-coast headed by Megacles the son of Alcmaeon, and that of the
Plain headed by Lycurgus, one of the Aristolaids, formed the project
of making himself tyrant, and with this view created a third party.
Gathering together a band of partisans, and giving himself out for the
protector of the Highlanders, he contrived the following stratagem. He
wounded himself and his mules, and then drove his chariot into the
market-place, professing to have just escaped an attack of his
enemies, who had attempted his life as he was on his way into the
country. He besought the people to assign him a guard to protect his
person, reminding them of the glory which he had gained when he led
the attack upon the Megarians, and took the town of Nisaea, at the
same time performing many other exploits. The Athenians, deceived by
his story, appointed him a band of citizens to serve as a guard, who
were to carry clubs instead of spears, and to accompany him wherever
he went. Thus strengthened, Pisistratus broke into revolt and seized
the citadel. In this way he acquired the sovereignty of Athens,
which he continued to hold without disturbing the previously
existing offices or altering any of the laws. He administered the
state according to the established usages, and his arrangements were
wise and salutary.

However, after a little time, the partisans of Megacles and
those of Lycurgus agreed to forget their differences, and united to
drive him out. So Pisistratus, having by the means described first
made himself master of Athens, lost his power again before it had time
to take root. No sooner, however, was he departed than the factions
which had driven him out quarrelled anew, and at last Megacles,
wearied with the struggle, sent a herald to Pisistratus, with an offer
to re-establish him on the throne if he would marry his daughter.
Pisistratus consented, and on these terms an agreement was concluded
between the two, after which they proceeded to devise the mode of
his restoration. And here the device on which they hit was the
silliest that I find on record, more especially considering that the
Greeks have been from very ancient times distinguished from the
barbarians by superior sagacity and freedom from foolish simpleness,
and remembering that the persons on whom this trick was played were
not only Greeks but Athenians, who have the credit of surpassing all
other Greeks in cleverness. There was in the Paeanian district a woman
named Phya, whose height only fell short of four cubits by three
fingers' breadth, and who was altogether comely to look upon. This
woman they clothed in complete armour, and, instructing her as to
the carriage which she was to maintain in order to beseem her part,
they placed her in a chariot and drove to the city. Heralds had been
sent forward to precede her, and to make proclamation to this
effect: "Citizens of Athens, receive again Pisistratus with friendly
minds. Minerva, who of all men honours him the most, herself
conducts him back to her own citadel." This they proclaimed in all
directions, and immediately the rumour spread throughout the country
districts that Minerva was bringing back her favourite. They of the
city also, fully persuaded that the woman was the veritable goddess,
prostrated themselves before her, and received Pisistratus back.

Pisistratus, having thus recovered the sovereignty, married,
according to agreement, the daughter of Megacles. As, however, he
had already a family of grown up sons, and the Alcmaeonidae were
supposed to be under a curse, he determined that there should be no
issue of the marriage. His wife at first kept this matter to
herself, but after a time, either her mother questioned her, or it may
be that she told it of her own accord. At any rate, she informed her
mother, and so it reached her father's ears. Megacles, indignant at
receiving an affront from such a quarter, in his anger instantly
made up his differences with the opposite faction, on which
Pisistratus, aware of what was planning against him, took himself
out of the country. Arrived at Eretria, he held a council with his
children to decide what was to be done. The opinion of Hippias
prevailed, and it was agreed to aim at regaining the sovereignty.
The first step was to obtain advances of money from such states as
were under obligations to them. By these means they collected large
sums from several countries, especially from the Thebans, who gave
them far more than any of the rest. To be brief, time passed, and
all was at length got ready for their return. A band of Argive
mercenaries arrived from the Peloponnese, and a certain Naxian named
Lygdamis, who volunteered his services, was particularly zealous in
the cause, supplying both men and money.

In the eleventh year of their exile the family of Pisistratus
set sail from Eretria on their return home. They made the coast of
Attica, near Marathon, where they encamped, and were joined by their
partisans from the capital and by numbers from the country
districts, who loved tyranny better than freedom. At Athens, while
Pisistratus was obtaining funds, and even after he landed at Marathon,
no one paid any attention to his proceedings. When, however, it became
known that he had left Marathon, and was marching upon the city,
preparations were made for resistance, the whole force of the state
was levied, and led against the returning exiles. Meantime the army of
Pisistratus, which had broken up from Marathon, meeting their
adversaries near the temple of the Pallenian Minerva, pitched their
camp opposite them. Here a certain soothsayer, Amphilytus by name,
an Acarnanian, moved by a divine impulse, came into the presence of
Pisistratus, and approaching him uttered this prophecy in the
hexameter measure:-

> Now has the cast been made, the net is out-spread in the water,
> 
> Through the moonshiny night the tunnies will enter the meshes.

Such was the prophecy uttered under a divine inspiration.
Pisistratus, apprehending its meaning, declared that he accepted the
oracle, and instantly led on his army. The Athenians from the city had
just finished their midday meal, after which they had betaken
themselves, some to dice, others to sleep, when Pisistratus with his
troops fell upon them and put them to the rout. As soon as the
flight began, Pisistratus bethought himself of a most wise
contrivance, whereby the might be induced to disperse and not unite in
a body any more. He mounted his sons on horseback and sent them on
in front to overtake the fugitives, and exhort them to be of good
cheer, and return each man to his home. The Athenians took the advice,
and Pisistratus became for the third time master of Athens.

Upon this he set himself to root his power more firmly, by the aid
of a numerous body of mercenaries, and by keeping up a full exchequer,
partly supplied from native sources, partly from the countries about
the river Strymon. He also demanded hostages from many of the
Athenians who had remained at home, and not left Athens at his
approach; and these he sent to Naxos, which he had conquered by
force of arms, and given over into the charge of Lygdamis. Farther, he
purified the island of Delos, according to the injunctions of an
oracle, after the following fashion. All the dead bodies which had
been interred within sight of the temple he dug up, and removed to
another part of the isle. Thus was the tyranny of Pisistratus
established at Athens, many of the Athenians having fallen in the
battle, and many others having fled the country together with the
son of Alcmaeon.

Such was the condition of the Athenians when Croesus made
inquiry concerning them. Proceeding to seek information concerning the
Lacedaemonians, he learnt that, after passing through a period of
great depression, they had lately been victorious in a war with the
people of Tegea; for, during the joint reign of Leo and Agasicles,
kings of Sparta, the Lacedaemonians, successful in all their other
wars, suffered continual defeat at the hands of the Tegeans. At a
still earlier period they had been the very worst governed people in
Greece, as well in matters of internal management as in their
relations towards foreigners, from whom they kept entirely aloof.
The circumstances which led to their being well governed were the
following:- Lycurgus, a man of distinction among the Spartans, had
gone to Delphi, to visit the oracle. Scarcely had he entered into
the inner fane, when the Pythoness exclaimed aloud,

> Oh! thou great Lycurgus, that com'st to my beautiful dwelling,  
> Dear to love, and to all who sit in the halls of Olympus,  
> Whether to hail thee a god I know not, or only a mortal,  
> But my hope is strong that a god thou wilt prove, Lycurgus.

Some report besides, that the Pythoness delivered to him the entire
system of laws which are still observed by the Spartans. The
Lacedaemonians, however. themselves assert that Lycurgus, when he
was guardian of his nephew, Labotas, king of Sparta, and regent in his
room, introduced them from Crete; for as soon as he became regent,
he altered the whole of the existing customs, substituting new ones,
which he took care should be observed by all. After this he arranged
whatever appertained to war, establishing the Enomotiae, Triacades,
and Syssitia, besides which he instituted the senate,' and the
ephoralty. Such was the way in which the Lacedaemonians became a
well-governed people.

On the death of Lycurgus they built him a temple, and ever since
they have worshipped him with the utmost reverence. Their soil being
good and the population numerous, they sprang up rapidly to power, and
became a flourishing people. In consequence they soon ceased to be
satisfied to stay quiet; and, regarding the Arcadians as very much
their inferiors, they sent to consult the oracle about conquering
the whole of Arcadia. The Pythoness thus answered them:

> Cravest thou Arcady? Bold is thy craving. I shall not content it.  
> Many the men that in Arcady dwell, whose food is the acorn-  
> They will never allow thee. It is not I that am niggard.  
> I will give thee to dance in Tegea, with noisy foot-fall,  
> And with the measuring line mete out the glorious champaign.

When the Lacedaemonians received this reply, leaving the rest of
Arcadia untouched, they marched against the Tegeans, carrying with
them fetters, so confident had this oracle (which was, in truth, but
of base metal) made them that they would enslave the Tegeans. The
battle, however, went against them, and many fell into the enemy's
hands. Then these persons, wearing the fetters which they had
themselves brought, and fastened together in a string, measured the
Tegean plain as they executed their labours. The fetters in which they
worked were still, in my day, preserved at Tegea where they hung round
the walls of the temple of Minerva Alea.

Throughout the whole of this early contest with the Tegeans, the
Lacedaemonians met with nothing but defeats; but in the time of
Croesus, under the kings Anaxandrides and  Aristo, fortune had
turned in their favour, in the manner which I will now relate.
Having been worsted in every engagement by their enemy, they sent to
Delphi, and inquired of the oracle what god they must propitiate to
prevail in the war against the Tegeans. The answer of the Pythoness
was that before they could prevail, they must remove to Sparta the
bones of Orestes, the son of Agamemnon. Unable to discover his
burial-place, they sent a second time, and asked the god where the
body of the hero had been laid. The following was the answer they
received:-

> Level and smooth is the plain where Arcadian Tegea standeth;  
> There two winds are ever, by strong necessity, blowing,  
> Counter-stroke answers stroke, and evil lies upon evil.  
> There all-teeming Earth doth harbour the son of Atrides;  
> Bring thou him to thy city, and then be Tegea's master.

After this reply, the Lacedaemonians were no nearer discovering the
burial-place than before, though they continued to search for it
diligently; until at last a man named Lichas, one of the Spartans
called Agathoergi, found it. The Agathoergi are citizens who have just
served their time among the knights. The five eldest of the knights go
out every year, and are bound during the year after their discharge to
go wherever the State sends them, and actively employ themselves in
its service.

Lichas was one of this body when, partly by good luck, partly by
his own wisdom, he discovered the burial-place. Intercourse between
the two States existing just at this time, he went to Tegea, and,
happening to enter into the workshop of a smith, he saw him forging
some iron. As he stood marvelling at what he beheld, he was observed
by the smith who, leaving off his work, went up to him and said,

"Certainly, then, you Spartan stranger, you would have been
wonderfully surprised if you had seen what I have, since you make a
marvel even of the working in iron. I wanted to make myself a well
in this room, and began to dig it, when what think you? I came upon
a coffin seven cubits long. I had never believed that men were
taller in the olden times than they are now, so I opened the coffin.
The body inside was of the same length: I measured it, and filled up
the hole again."

Such was the man's account of what he had seen. The other, on
turning the matter over in his mind, conjectured that this was the
body of Orestes, of which the oracle had spoken. He guessed so,
because he observed that the smithy had two bellows, which he
understood to be the two winds, and the hammer and anvil would do
for the stroke and the counterstroke, and the iron that was being
wrought for the evil lying upon evil. This he imagined might be so
because iron had been discovered to the hurt of man. Full of these
conjectures, he sped back to Sparta and laid the whole matter before
his countrymen. Soon after, by a concerted plan, they brought a charge
against him, and began a prosecution. Lichas betook himself to
Tegea, and on his arrival acquainted the smith with his misfortune,
and proposed to rent his room of him. The smith refused for some time;
but at last Lichas persuaded him, and took up his abode in it. Then he
opened the grave, and collecting the bones, returned with them to
Sparta. From henceforth, whenever the Spartans and the Tegeans made
trial of each other's skill in arms, the Spartans always had greatly
the advantage; and by the time to which we are now come they were
masters of most of the Peloponnese.

Croesus, informed of all these circumstances, sent messengers to
Sparta, with gifts in their hands, who were to ask the Spartans to
enter into alliance with him. They received strict injunctions as to
what they should say, and on their arrival at Sparta spake as
follows:-

"Croesus, king of the Lydians and of other nations, has sent us to
speak thus to you: 'Oh Lacedaemonians, the god has bidden me to make
the Greek my friend; I therefore apply to you, in conformity with
the oracle, knowing that you hold the first rank in Greece, and desire
to become your friend and ally in all true faith and honesty.'"

Such was the message which Croesus sent by his heralds. The
Lacedaemonians, who were aware beforehand of the reply given him by
the oracle, were full of joy at the coming of the messengers, and at
once took the oaths of friendship and alliance: this they did the more
readily as they had previously contracted certain obligations
towards him. They had sent to Sardis on one occasion to purchase
some gold, intending to use it on a statue of Apollo- the statue,
namely, which remains to this day at Thornax in Laconia, when Croesus,
hearing of the matter, gave them as a gift the gold which they wanted.

This was one reason why the Lacedaemonians were so willing to make
the alliance: another was, because Croesus had chosen them for his
friends in preference to all the other Greeks. They therefore held
themselves in readiness to come at his summons, and not content with
so doing, they further had a huge vase made in bronze, covered with
figures of animals all round the outside of the rim, and large
enough to contain three hundred amphorae, which they sent to Croesus
as a return for his presents to them. The vase, however, never reached
Sardis. Its miscarriage is accounted for in two quite different
ways. The Lacedaemonian story is that when it reached Samos, on its
way towards Sardis, the Samians having knowledge of it, put to sea
in their ships of war and made it their prize. But the Samians declare
that the Lacedaemonians who had the vase in charge, happening to
arrive too late, and learning that Sardis had fallen and that
Croesus was a prisoner, sold it in their island, and the purchasers
(who were, they say, private persons) made an offering of it at the
shrine of Juno: the sellers were very likely on their return to Sparta
to have said that they had been robbed of it by the Samians. Such,
then, was the fate of the vase.

Meanwhile Croesus, taking the oracle in a wrong sense, led his
forces into Cappadocia, fully expecting to defeat Cyrus and destroy
the empire of the Persians. While he was still engaged in making
preparations for his attack, a Lydian named Sandanis, who had always
been looked upon as a wise man, but who after this obtained a very
great name indeed among his countrymen, came forward and counselled
the king in these words:

"Thou art about, oh! king, to make war against men who wear
leathern trousers, and have all their other garments of leather; who
feed not on what they like, but on what they can get from a soil
that is sterile and unkindly; who do not indulge in wine, but drink
water; who possess no figs nor anything else that is good to eat.
If, then, thou conquerest them, what canst thou get from them,
seeing that they have nothing at all? But if they conquer thee,
consider how much that is precious thou wilt lose: if they once get
a taste of our pleasant things, they will keep such hold of them
that we shall never be able to make them loose their grasp. For my
part, I am thankful to the gods that they have not put it into the
hearts of the Persians to invade Lydia."

Croesus was not persuaded by this speech, though it was true
enough; for before the conquest of Lydia, the Persians possessed
none of the luxuries or delights of life.

The Cappadocians are known to the Greeks by the name of Syrians.
Before the rise of the Persian power, they had been subject to the
Medes; but at the present time they were within the empire of Cyrus,
for the boundary between the Median and the Lydian empires was the
river Halys. This stream, which rises in the mountain country of
Armenia, runs first through Cilicia; afterwards it flows for a while
with the Matieni on the right, and the Phrygians on the left: then,
when they are passed, it proceeds with a northern course, separating
the Cappadocian Syrians from the Paphlagonians, who occupy the left
bank, thus forming the boundary of almost the whole of Lower Asia,
from the sea opposite Cyprus to the Euxine. Just there is the neck
of the peninsula, a journey of five days across for an active walker.

There were two motives which led Croesus to attack Cappadocia:
firstly, he coveted the land, which he wished to add to his own
dominions; but the chief reason was that he wanted to revenge on Cyrus
the wrongs of Astyages, and was made confident by the oracle of
being able so to do: for Astyages, son of Cyaxares and king of the
Medes, who had been dethroned by Cyrus, son of Cambyses, was
Croesus' brother by marriage. This marriage had taken place under
circumstances which I will now relate. A band of Scythian nomads,
who had left their own land on occasion of some disturbance, had taken
refuge in Media. Cyaxares, son of Phraortes, and grandson of
Deioces, was at that time king of the country. Recognising them as
suppliants, he began by treating them with kindness, and coming
presently to esteem them highly, he intrusted to their care a number
of boys, whom they were to teach their language and to instruct in the
use of the bow. Time passed, and the Scythians employed themselves,
day after day, in hunting, and always brought home some game; but at
last it chanced that one day they took nothing. On their return to
Cyaxares with empty hands, that monarch, who was hot-tempered, as he
showed upon the occasion, received them very rudely and insultingly.
In consequence of this treatment, which they did not conceive
themselves to have deserved, the Scythians determined to take one of
the boys whom they had in charge, cut him in pieces, and then dressing
the flesh as they were wont to dress that of the wild animals, serve
it up to Cyaxares as game: after which they resolved to convey
themselves with all speed to Sardis, to the court of Alyattes, the son
of Sadyattes. The plan was carried out: Cyaxares and his guests ate of
the flesh prepared by the Scythians, and they themselves, having
accomplished their purpose, fled to Alyattes in the guise of
suppliants.

Afterwards, on the refusal of Alyattes to give up his suppliants
when Cyaxares sent to demand them of him, war broke out between the
Lydians and the Medes, and continued for five years, with various
success. In the course of it the Medes gained many victories over
the Lydians, and the Lydians also gained many victories over the
Medes. Among their other battles there was one night engagement. As,
however, the balance had not inclined in favour of either nation,
another combat took place in the sixth year, in the course of which,
just as the battle was growing warm, day was on a sudden changed
into night. This event had been foretold by Thales, the Milesian,
who forewarned the Ionians of it, fixing for it the very year in which
it actually took place. The Medes and Lydians, when they observed
the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of
peace agreed on. Syennesis of Cilicia, and Labynetus of Babylon,
were the persons who mediated between the parties, who hastened the
taking of the oaths, and brought about the exchange of espousals. It
was they who advised that Alyattes should give his daughter Aryenis in
marriage to Astyages, the son of Cyaxares, knowing, as they did,
that without some sure bond of strong necessity, there is wont to be
but little security in men's covenants. Oaths are taken by these
people in the same way as by the Greeks, except that they make a
slight flesh wound in their arms, from which each sucks a portion of
the other's blood.

Cyrus had captured this Astyages, who was his mother's father, and
kept him prisoner, for a reason which I shall bring forward in another
of my history. This capture formed the ground of quarrel between Cyrus
and Croesus, in consequence of which Croesus sent his servants to
ask the oracle if he should attack the Persians; and when an evasive
answer came, fancying it to be in his favour, carried his arms into
the Persian territory. When he reached the river Halys, he transported
his army across it, as I maintain, by the bridges which exist there at
the present day; but, according to the general belief of the Greeks,
by the aid of Thales the Milesian. The tale is that Croesus was in
doubt how he should get his army across, as the bridges were not
made at that time, and that Thales, who happened to be in the camp,
divided the stream and caused it to flow on both sides of the army
instead of on the left only. This he effected thus:- Beginning some
distance above the camp, he dug a deep channel, which he brought round
in a semicircle, so that it might pass to rearward of the camp; and
that thus the river, diverted from its natural course into the new
channel at the point where this left the stream, might flow by the
station of the army, and afterwards fall again into the ancient bed.
In this way the river was split into two streams, which were both
easily fordable. It is said by some that the water was entirely
drained off from the natural bed of the river. But I am of a different
opinion; for I do not see how, in that case, they could have crossed
it on their return.

Having passed the Halys with the forces under his command, Croesus
entered the district of Cappadocia which is called Pteria. It lies
in the neighbourhood of the city of Sinope upon the Euxine, and is the
strongest position in the whole country thereabouts. Here Croesus
pitched his camp, and began to ravage the fields of the Syrians. He
besieged and took the chief city of the Pterians, and reduced the
inhabitants to slavery: he likewise made himself master of the
surrounding villages. Thus he brought ruin on the Syrians, who were
guilty of no offence towards him. Meanwhile, Cyrus had levied an
army and marched against Croesus, increasing his numbers at every step
by the forces of the nations that lay in his way. Before beginning his
march he had sent heralds to the Ionians, with an invitation to them
to revolt from the Lydian king: they, however, had refused compliance.
Cyrus, notwithstanding, marched against the enemy, and encamped
opposite them in the district of Pteria, where the trial of strength
took place between the contending powers. The combat was hot and
bloody, and upon both sides the number of the slain was great; nor had
victory declared in favour of either party, when night came down
upon the battle-field. Thus both armies fought valiantly.

Croesus laid the blame of his ill success on the number of his
troops, which fell very short of the enemy; and as on the next day
Cyrus did not repeat the attack, he set off on his return to Sardis,
intending to collect his allies and renew the contest in the spring.
He meant to call on the Egyptians to send him aid, according to the
terms of the alliance which he had concluded with Amasis, previously
to his league with the Lacedaemonians. He intended also to summon to
his assistance the Babylonians, under their king Labynetus, for they
too were bound to him by treaty: and further, he meant to send word to
Sparta, and appoint a day for the coming of their succours. Having got
together these forces in addition to his own, he would, as soon as the
winter was past and springtime come, march once more against the
Persians. With these intentions Croesus, immediately on his return,
despatched heralds to his various allies, with a request that they
would join him at Sardis in the course of the fifth month from the
time of the departure of his messengers. He then disbanded the army
consisting of mercenary troops- which had been engaged with the
Persians and had since accompanied him to his capital, and let them
depart to their homes, never imagining that Cyrus, after a battle in
which victory had been so evenly balanced, would venture to march upon
Sardis.

While Croesus was still in this mind, all the suburbs of Sardis
were found to swarm with snakes, on the appearance of which the horses
left feeding in the pasture-grounds, and flocked to the suburbs to eat
them. The king, who witnessed the unusual sight, regarded it very
rightly as a prodigy. He therefore instantly sent messengers to the
soothsayers of Telmessus, to consult them upon the matter, His
messengers reached the city, and obtained from the Telmessians an
explanation of what the prodigy portended, but fate did not allow them
to inform their lord; for ere they entered Sardis on their return,
Croesus was a prisoner. What the Telmessians had declared was that
Croesus must look for the entry of an army of foreign invaders into
his country, and that when they came they would subdue the native
inhabitants; since the snake, said they, is a child of earth, and
the horse a warrior and a foreigner. Croesus was already a prisoner
when the Telmessians thus answered his inquiry, but they had no
knowledge of what was taking place at Sardis, or of the fate of the
monarch.

Cyrus, however, when Croesus broke up so suddenly from his
quarters after the battle at Pteria, conceiving that he had marched
away with the intention of disbanding his army, considered a little,
and soon saw that it was advisable for him to advance upon Sardis with
all haste, before the Lydians could get their forces together a second
time. Having thus determined, he lost no time in carrying out his
plan. He marched forward with such speed that he was himself the first
to announce his coming to the Lydian king. That monarch, placed in the
utmost difficulty by the turn of events which had gone so entirely
against all his calculations, nevertheless led out the Lydians to
battle. In all Asia there was not at that time a braver or more
warlike people. Their manner of fighting was on horseback; they
carried long lances, and were clever in the management of their
steeds.

The two armies met in the plain before Sardis. It is a vast
flat, bare of trees, watered by the Hyllus and a number of other
streams, which all flow into one larger than the rest, called the
Hermus. This river rises in the sacred mountain of the Dindymenian
Mother, and falls into the sea near the town of Phocaea.

When Cyrus beheld the Lydians arranging themselves in order of
battle on this plain, fearful of the strength of their cavalry, he
adopted a device which Harpagus, one of the Medes, suggested to him.
He collected together all the camels that had come in the train of his
army to carry the provisions and the baggage, and taking off their
loads, he mounted riders upon them accoutred as horsemen. These he
commanded to advance in front of his other troops against the Lydian
horse; behind them were to follow the foot soldiers, and last of all
the cavalry. When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops
orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without
mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be
seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels
to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of
the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that
animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless
to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The
two armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian
war-horses, seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and
galloped off; and so it came to pass that all Croesus's hopes withered
away. The Lydians, however, behaved manfully. As soon as they
understood what was happening, they leaped off their horses, and
engaged with the Persians on foot. The combat was long; but at last,
after a great slaughter on both sides, the Lydians turned and fled.
They were driven within their walls and the Persians laid siege to
Sardis.

Thus the siege began. Meanwhile Croesus, thinking that the place
would hold out no inconsiderable time, sent off fresh heralds to his
allies from the beleaguered town. His former messengers had been
charged to bid them assemble at Sardis in the course of the fifth
month; they whom he now sent were to say that he was already besieged,
and to beseech them to come to his aid with all possible speed.
Among his other allies Croesus did not omit to send to Lacedaemon.

It chanced, however, that the Spartans were themselves just at
this time engaged in a quarrel with the Argives about a place called
Thyrea, which was within the limits of Argolis, but had been seized on
by the Lacedaemonians. Indeed, the whole country westward, as far as
Cape Malea, belonged once to the Argives, and not only that entire
tract upon the mainland, but also Cythera, and the other islands.
The Argives collected troops to resist the seizure of Thyrea, but
before any battle was fought, the two parties came to terms, and it
was agreed that three hundred Spartans and three hundred Argives
should meet and fight for the place, which should belong to the nation
with whom the victory rested. It was stipulated also that the other
troops on each side should return home to their respective
countries, and not remain to witness the combat, as there was
danger, if the armies stayed, that either the one or the other, on
seeing their countrymen undergoing defeat, might hasten to their
assistance. These terms being agreed on, the two armies marched off,
leaving three hundred picked men on each side to fight for the
territory. The battle began, and so equal were the combatants, that at
the close of the day, when night put a stop to the fight, of the whole
six hundred only three men remained alive, two Argives, Alcanor and
Chromius, and a single Spartan, Othryadas. The two Argives,
regarding themselves as the victors, hurried to Argos. Othryadas,
the Spartan, remained upon the field, and, stripping the bodies of the
Argives who had fallen, carried their armour to the Spartan camp. Next
day the two armies returned to learn the result. At first they
disputed, both parties claiming the victory, the one, because they had
the greater number of survivors; the other, because their man remained
on the field, and stripped the bodies of the slain, whereas the two
men of the other side ran away; but at last they fell from words to
blows, and a battle was fought, in which both parties suffered great
loss, but at the end the Lacedaemonians gained the victory. Upon
this the Argives, who up to that time had worn their hair long, cut it
off close, and made a law, to which they attached a curse, binding
themselves never more to let their hair grow, and never to allow their
women to wear gold, until they should recover Thyrea. At the same time
the Lacedaemonians made a law the very reverse of this, namely, to
wear their hair long, though they had always before cut it close.
Othryadas himself, it is said, the sole survivor of the three hundred,
prevented by a sense of shame from returning to Sparta after all his
comrades had fallen, laid violent hands upon himself in Thyrea.

Although the Spartans were engaged with these matters when the
herald arrived from Sardis to entreat them to come to the assistance
of the besieged king, yet, notwithstanding, they instantly set to work
to afford him help. They had completed their preparations, and the
ships were just ready to start, when a second message informed them
that the place had already fallen, and that Croesus was a prisoner.
Deeply grieved at his misfortune, the Spartans ceased their efforts.

The following is the way in which Sardis was taken. On the
fourteenth day of the siege Cyrus bade some horsemen ride about his
lines, and make proclamation to the whole army that he would give a
reward to the man who should first mount the wall. After this he
made an assault, but without success. His troops retired, but a
certain Mardian, Hyroeades by name, resolved to approach the citadel
and attempt it at a place where no guards were ever set. On this
side the rock was so precipitous, and the citadel (as it seemed) so
impregnable, that no fear was entertained of its being carried in this
place. Here was the only portion of the circuit round which their
old king Meles did not carry the lion which his leman bore to him. For
when the Telmessians had declared that if the lion were taken round
the defences, Sardis would be impregnable, and Meles, in
consequence, carried it round the rest of the fortress where the
citadel seemed open to attack, he scorned to take it round this
side, which he looked on as a sheer precipice, and therefore
absolutely secure. It is on that side of the city which faces Mount
Tmolus. Hyroeades, however, having the day before observed a Lydian
soldier descend the rock after a helmet that had rolled down from
the top, and having seen him pick it up and carry it back, thought
over what he had witnessed, and formed his plan. He climbed the rock
himself, and other Persians followed in his track, until a large
number had mounted to the top. Thus was Sardis taken, and given up
entirely to pillage.

With respect to Croesus himself, this is what befell him at the
taking of the town. He had a son, of whom I made mention above, a
worthy youth, whose only defect was that he was deaf and dumb. In
the days of his prosperity Croesus had done the utmost that be could
for him, and among other plans which he had devised, had sent to
Delphi to consult the oracle on his behalf. The answer which he had
received from the Pythoness ran thus:-

> Lydian, wide-ruling monarch, thou wondrous simple Croesus,  
> Wish not ever to hear in thy palace the voice thou hast prayed for  
> Uttering intelligent sounds. Far better thy son should be silent!  
> Ah! woe worth the day when thine car shall first list to his
>  accents.

When the town was taken, one of the Persians was just going to
kill Croesus, not knowing who he was. Croesus saw the man coming,
but under the pressure of his affliction, did not care to avoid the
blow, not minding whether or no he died beneath the stroke. Then
this son of his, who was voiceless, beholding the Persian as he rushed
towards Croesus, in the agony of his fear and grief burst into speech,
and said, "Man, do not kill Croesus." This was the first time that
he had ever spoken a word, but afterwards he retained the power of
speech for the remainder of his life.

Thus was Sardis taken by the Persians, and Croesus himself fell
into their hands, after having reigned fourteen years, and been
besieged in his capital fourteen days; thus too did Croesus fulfill
the oracle, which said that he should destroy a mighty empire by
destroying his own. Then the Persians who had made Croesus prisoner
brought him before Cyrus. Now a vast pile had been raised by his
orders, and Croesus, laden with fetters, was placed upon it, and
with him twice seven of the sons of the Lydians. I know not whether
Cyrus was minded to make an offering of the to some god or other, or
whether he had vowed a vow and was performing it, or whether, as may
well be, he had heard that Croesus was a holy man, and so wished to
see if any of the heavenly powers would appear to save him from
being burnt alive. However it might be, Cyrus was thus engaged, and
Croesus was already on the pile, when it entered his mind in the depth
of his woe that there was a divine warning in the words which had come
to him from the lips of Solon, "No one while he lives is happy."
When this thought smote him he fetched a long breath, and breaking his
deep silence, groaned out aloud, thrice uttering the name of Solon.
Cyrus caught the sounds, and bade the interpreters inquire of
Croesus who it was he called on. They drew near and asked him, but
he held his peace, and for a long time made no answer to their
questionings, until at length, forced to say something, he
exclaimed, "One I would give much to see converse with every monarch."
Not knowing what he meant by this reply, the interpreters begged him
to explain himself; and as they pressed for an answer, and grew to
be troublesome, he told them how, a long time before, Solon, an
Athenian, had come and seen all his splendour, and made light of it;
and how whatever he had said to him had fallen out exactly as he
foreshowed, although it was nothing that especially concerned him, but
applied to all mankind alike, and most to those who seemed to
themselves happy. Meanwhile, as he thus spoke, the pile was lighted,
and the outer portion began to blaze. Then Cyrus, hearing from the
interpreters what Croesus had said, relented, bethinking himself
that he too was a man, and that it was a fellow-man, and one who had
once been as blessed by fortune as himself, that he was burning alive;
afraid, moreover, of retribution, and full of the thought that
whatever is human is insecure. So he bade them quench the blazing fire
as quickly as they could, and take down Croesus and the other Lydians,
which they tried to do, but the flames were not to be mastered.

Then, the Lydians say that Croesus, perceiving by the efforts made
to quench the fire that Cyrus had relented, and seeing also that all
was in vain, and that the men could not get the fire under, called
with a loud voice upon the god Apollo, and prayed him, if he ever
received at his hands any acceptable gift, to come to his aid, and
deliver him from his present danger. As thus with tears he besought
the god, suddenly, though up to that time the sky had been clear and
the day without a breath of wind, dark clouds gathered, and the
storm burst over their heads with rain of such violence, that the
flames were speedily extinguished. Cyrus, convinced by this that
Croesus was a good man and a favourite of heaven, asked him after he
was taken off the pile, "Who it was that had persuaded him to lead
an army into his country, and so become his foe rather than continue
his friend?" to which Croesus made answer as follows: "What I did, oh!
king, was to thy advantage and to my own loss. If there be blame, it
rests with the god of the Greeks, who encouraged me to begin the
war. No one is so foolish as to prefer war to peace, in which, instead
of sons burying their fathers, fathers bury their sons. But the gods
willed it so."

Thus did Croesus speak. Cyrus then ordered his fetters to be taken
off, and made him sit down near himself, and paid him much respect,
looking upon him, as did also the courtiers, with a sort of wonder.
Croesus, wrapped in thought, uttered no word. After a while, happening
to turn and perceive the Persian soldiers engaged in plundering the
town, he said to Cyrus, "May I now tell thee, oh! king, what I have in
my mind, or is silence best?" Cyrus bade him speak his mind boldly.
Then he put this question: "What is it, oh! Cyrus, which those men
yonder are doing so busily?" "Plundering thy city," Cyrus answered,
"and carrying off thy riches." "Not my city," rejoined the other, "nor
my riches. They are not mine any more. It is thy wealth which they are
pillaging."

Cyrus, struck by what Croesus had said, bade all the court to
withdraw, and then asked Croesus what he thought it best for him to do
as regarded the plundering. Croesus answered, "Now that the gods
have made me thy slave, oh! Cyrus, it seems to me that it is my
part, if I see anything to thy advantage, to show it to thee. Thy
subjects, the Persians, are a poor people with a proud spirit. If then
thou lettest them pillage and possess themselves of great wealth, I
will tell thee what thou hast to expect at their hands. The man who
gets the most, look to having him rebel against thee. Now then, if
my words please thee, do thus, oh! king:- Let some of thy bodyguards
be placed as sentinels at each of the city gates, and let them take
their booty from the soldiers as they leave the town, and tell them
that they do so because the tenths are due to Jupiter. So wilt thou
escape the hatred they would feel if the plunder were taken away
from them by force; and they, seeing that what is proposed is just,
will do it willingly."

Cyrus was beyond measure pleased with this advice, so excellent
did it seem to him. He praised Croesus highly, and gave orders to
his bodyguard to do as he had suggested. Then, turning to Croesus,
he said, "Oh! Croesus, I see that thou are resolved both in speech and
act to show thyself a virtuous prince: ask me, therefore, whatever
thou wilt as a gift at this moment." Croesus replied, "Oh! my lord, if
thou wilt suffer me to send these fetters to the god of the Greeks,
whom I once honoured above all other gods, and ask him if it is his
wont to deceive his benefactors- that will be the highest favour
thou canst confer on me." Cyrus upon this inquired what charge he
had to make against the god. Then Croesus gave him a full account of
all his projects, and of the answers of the oracle, and of the
offerings which he had sent, on which he dwelt especially, and told
him how it was the encouragement given him by the oracle which had led
him to make war upon Persia. All this he related, and at the end again
besought permission to reproach the god with his behaviour. Cyrus
answered with a laugh, "This I readily grant thee, and whatever else
thou shalt at any time ask at my hands." Croesus, finding his
request allowed, sent certain Lydians to Delphi, enjoining them to lay
his fetters upon the threshold of the temple, and ask the god, "If
he were not ashamed of having encouraged him, as the destined
destroyer of the empire of Cyrus, to begin a war with Persia, of which
such were the first-fruits?" As they said this they were to point to
the fetters- and further they were to inquire, "If it was the wont
of the Greek gods to be ungrateful?"

The Lydians went to Delphi and delivered their message, on which
the Pythoness is said to have replied- "It is not possible even for
a god to escape the decree of destiny. Croesus has been punished for
the sin of his fifth ancestor, who, when he was one of the bodyguard
of the Heraclides, joined in a woman's fraud, and, slaying his master,
wrongfully seized the throne. Apollo was anxious that the fall of
Sardis should not happen in the lifetime of Croesus, but be delayed to
his son's days; he could not, however, persuade the Fates. All that
they were willing to allow he took and gave to Croesus. Let Croesus
know that Apollo delayed the taking of Sardis three full years, and
that he is thus a prisoner three years later than was his destiny.
Moreover it was Apollo who saved him from the burning pile. Nor has
Croesus any right to complain with respect to the oracular answer
which he received. For when the god told him that, if he attacked
the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire, he ought, if he had
been wise, to have sent again and inquired which empire was meant,
that of Cyrus or his own; but if he neither understood what was
said, nor took the trouble to seek for enlightenment, he has only
himself to blame for the result. Besides, he had misunderstood the
last answer which had been given him about the mule. Cyrus was that
mule. For the parents of Cyrus were of different races, and of
different conditions- his mother a Median princess, daughter of King
Astyages, and his father a Persian and a subject, who, though so far
beneath her in all respects, had married his royal mistress."

Such was the answer of the Pythoness. The Lydians returned to
Sardis and communicated it to Croesus, who confessed, on hearing it,
that the fault was his, not the god's. Such was the way in which Ionia
was first conquered, and so was the empire of Croesus brought to a
close.

Besides the offerings which have been already mentioned, there are
many others in various parts of Greece presented by Croesus; as at
Thebes in Boeotia, where there is a golden tripod, dedicated by him to
Ismenian Apollo; at Ephesus, where the golden heifers, and most of the
columns are his gift; and at Delphi, in the temple of Pronaia, where
there is a huge shield in gold, which he gave. All these offerings
were still in existence in my day; many others have perished: among
them those which he dedicated at Branchidae in Milesia, equal in
weight, as I am informed, and in all respects like to those at Delphi.
The Delphian presents, and those sent to Amphiaraus, came from his own
private property, being the first-fruits of the fortune which he
inherited from his father; his other offerings came from the riches of
an enemy, who, before he mounted the throne, headed a party against
him, with the view of obtaining the crown of Lydia for Pantaleon. This
Pantaleon was a son of Alyattes, but by a different mother from
Croesus; for the mother of Croesus was a Carian woman, but the
mother of Pantaleon an Ionian. When, by the appointment of his father,
Croesus obtained the kingly dignity, he seized the man who had plotted
against him, and broke him upon the wheel. His property, which he
had previously devoted to the service of the gods, Croesus applied
in the way mentioned above. This is all I shall say about his
offerings.

Lydia, unlike most other countries, scarcely offers any wonders
for the historian to describe, except the gold-dust which is washed
down from the range of Tmolus. It has, however, one structure of
enormous size, only inferior to the monuments of Egypt and Babylon.
This is the tomb of Alyattes, the father of Croesus, the base of which
is formed of immense blocks of stone, the rest being a vast mound of
earth. It was raised by the joint labour of the tradesmen,
handicraftsmen, and courtesans of Sardis, and had at the top five
stone pillars, which remained to my day, with inscriptions cut on
them, showing how much of the work was done by each class of
workpeople. It appeared on measurement that the portion of the
courtesans was the largest. The daughters of the common people in
Lydia, one and all, pursue this traffic, wishing to collect money
for their portions. They continue the practice till they marry; and
are wont to contract themselves in marriage. The tomb is six stades
and two plethra in circumference; its breadth is thirteen plethra.
Close to the tomb is a large lake, which the Lydians say is never dry.
They call it the Lake Gygaea.

The Lydians have very nearly the same customs as the Greeks,
with the exception that these last do not bring up their girls in
the same way. So far as we have any knowledge, they were the first
nation to introduce the use of gold and silver coin, and the first who
sold goods by retail. They claim also the invention of all the games
which are common to them with the Greeks. These they declare that they
invented about the time when they colonised Tyrrhenia, an event of
which they give the following account. In the days of Atys, the son of
Manes, there was great scarcity through the whole land of Lydia. For
some time the Lydians bore the affliction patiently, but finding
that it did not pass away, they set to work to devise remedies for the
evil. Various expedients were discovered by various persons; dice, and
huckle-bones, and ball, and all such games were invented, except
tables, the invention of which they do not claim as theirs. The plan
adopted against the famine was to engage in games one day so
entirely as not to feel any craving for food, and the next day to
eat and abstain from games. In this way they passed eighteen years.
Still the affliction continued and even became more grievous. So the
king determined to divide the nation in half, and to make the two
portions draw lots, the one to stay, the other to leave the land. He
would continue to reign over those whose lot it should be to remain
behind; the emigrants should have his son Tyrrhenus for their
leader. The lot was cast, and they who had to emigrate went down to
Smyrna, and built themselves ships, in which, after they had put on
board all needful stores, they sailed away in search of new homes
and better sustenance. After sailing past many countries they came
to Umbria, where they built cities for themselves, and fixed their
residence. Their former name of Lydians they laid aside, and called
themselves after the name of the king's son, who led the colony,
Tyrrhenians.

Thus far I have been engaged in showing how the Lydians were
brought under the Persian yoke. The course of my history now compels
me to inquire who this Cyrus was by whom the Lydian empire was
destroyed, and by what means the Persians had become the lords
paramount of Asia. And herein I shall follow those Persian authorities
whose object it appears to be not to magnify the exploits of Cyrus,
but to relate the simple truth. I know besides three ways in which the
story of Cyrus is told, all differing from my own narrative.

The Assyrians had held the Empire of Upper Asia for the space of
five hundred and twenty years, when the Medes set the example of
revolt from their authority. They took arms for the recovery of
their freedom, and fought a battle with the Assyrians, in which they
behaved with such gallantry as to shake off the yoke of servitude, and
to become a free people. Upon their success the other nations also
revolted and regained their independence.

Thus the nations over that whole extent of country obtained the
blessing of self-government, but they fell again under the sway of
kings, in the manner which I will now relate. There was a certain Mede
named Deioces, son of Phraortes, a man of much wisdom, who had
conceived the desire of obtaining to himself the sovereign power. In
furtherance of his ambition, therefore, he formed and carried into
execution the following scheme. As the Medes at that time dwelt in
scattered villages without any central authority, and lawlessness in
consequence prevailed throughout the land, Deioces, who was already
a man of mark in his own village, applied himself with greater zeal
and earnestness than ever before to the practice of justice among
his fellows. It was his conviction that justice and injustice are
engaged in perpetual war with one another. He therefore began his
course of conduct, and presently the men of his village, observing his
integrity, chose him to be the arbiter of all their disputes. Bent
on obtaining the sovereign power, he showed himself an honest and an
upright judge, and by these means gained such credit with his
fellow-citizens as to attract the attention of those who lived in
the surrounding villages. They had long been suffering from unjust and
oppressive judgments; so that, when they heard of the singular
uprightness of Deioces, and of the equity of his decisions, they
joyfully had recourse to him in the various quarrels and suits that
arose, until at last they came to put confidence in no one else.

The number of complaints brought before him continually
increasing, as people learnt more and more the fairness of his
judgments, Deioces, feeling himself now all important, announced
that he did not intend any longer to hear causes, and appeared no more
in the seat in which he had been accustomed to sit and administer
justice. "It did not square with his interests," he said, "to spend
the whole day in regulating other men's affairs to the neglect of
his own." Hereupon robbery and lawlessness broke out afresh, and
prevailed through the country even more than heretofore; wherefore the
Medes assembled from all quarters, and held a consultation on the
state of affairs. The speakers, as I think, were chiefly friends of
Deioces. "We cannot possibly," they said, "go on living in this
country if things continue as they now are; let us therefore set a
king over us, that so the land may be well governed, and we
ourselves may be able to attend to our own affairs, and not be
forced to quit our country on account of anarchy." The assembly was
persuaded by these arguments, and resolved to appoint a king.

It followed to determine who should be chosen to the office.
When this debate began the claims of Deioces and his praises were at
once in every mouth; so that presently all agreed that he should be
king. Upon this he required a palace to be built for him suitable to
his rank, and a guard to be given him for his person. The Medes
complied, and built him a strong and large palace, on a spot which
he himself pointed out, and likewise gave him liberty to choose
himself a bodyguard from the whole nation. Thus settled upon the
throne, he further required them to build a single great city, and,
disregarding the petty towns in which they had formerly dwelt, make
the new capital the object of their chief attention. The Medes were
again obedient, and built the city now called Agbatana, the walls of
which are of great size and strength, rising in circles one within the
other. The plan of the place is that each of the walls should
out-top the one beyond it by the battlements. The nature of the
ground, which is a gentle hill, favours this arrangement in some
degree, but it was mainly effected by art. The number of the circles
is seven, the royal palace and the treasuries standing within the
last. The circuit of the outer wall is very nearly the same with
that of Athens. Of this wall the battlements are white, of the next
black, of the third scarlet, of the fourth blue, of the fifth
orange; all these are coloured with paint. The two last have their
battlements coated respectively with silver and gold.

All these fortifications Deioces caused to be raised for himself
and his own palace. The people were required to build their
dwellings outside the circuit of the walls. When the town was
finished, he proceeded to arrange the ceremonial. He allowed no one to
have direct access to the person of the king, but made all
communication pass through the hands of messengers, and forbade the
king to be seen by his subjects. He also made it an offence for any
one whatsoever to laugh or spit in the royal presence. This
ceremonial, of which he was the first inventor, Deioces established
for his own security, fearing that his compeers, who were brought up
together with him, and were of as good family as he, and no whit
inferior to him in manly qualities, if they saw him frequently would
be pained at the sight, and would therefore be likely to conspire
against him; whereas if they did not see him, they would think him
quite a different sort of being from themselves.

After completing these arrangements, and firmly settling himself
upon the throne, Deioces continued to administer justice with the same
strictness as before. Causes were stated in writing, and sent in to
the king, who passed his judgment upon the contents, and transmitted
his decisions to the parties concerned: besides which he had spies and
eavesdroppers in all parts of his dominions, and if he heard of any
act of oppression, he sent for the guilty party, and awarded him the
punishment meet for his offence.

Thus Deioces collected the Medes into a nation, and ruled over
them alone. Now these are the tribes of which they consist: the Busae,
the Paretaceni, the Struchates, the Arizanti, the Budii, and the Magi.

Having reigned three-and-fifty years, Deioces was at his death
succeeded by his son Phraortes. This prince, not satisfied with a
dominion which did not extend beyond the single nation of the Medes,
began by attacking the Persians; and marching an army into their
country, brought them under the Median yoke before any other people.
After this success, being now at the head of two nations, both of them
powerful, he proceeded to conquer Asia, overrunning province after
province. At last he engaged in war with the Assyrians- those
Assyrians, I mean, to whom Nineveh belonged, who were formerly the
lords of Asia. At present they stood alone by the revolt and desertion
of their allies, yet still their internal condition was as flourishing
as ever. Phraortes attacked them, but perished in the expedition
with the greater part of his army, after having reigned over the Medes
two-and-twenty years.

On the death of Phraortes his son Cyaxares ascended the throne. Of
him it is reported that he was still more war-like than any of his
ancestors, and that he was the first who gave organisation to an
Asiatic army, dividing the troops into companies, and forming distinct
bodies of the spearmen, the archers, and the cavalry, who before his
time had been mingled in one mass, and confused together. He it was
who fought against the Lydians on the occasion when the day was
changed suddenly into night, and who brought under his dominion the
whole of Asia beyond the Halys. This prince, collecting together all
the nations which owned his sway, marched against Nineveh, resolved to
avenge his father, and cherishing a hope that he might succeed in
taking the town. A battle was fought, in which the Assyrians
suffered a defeat, and Cyaxares had already begun the siege of the
place, when a numerous horde of Scyths, under their king Madyes, son
of Prtotohyes, burst into Asia in pursuit of the Cimmerians whom
they had driven out of Europe, and entered the Median territory.

The distance from the Palus Maeotis to the river Phasis and the
Colchians is thirty days' journey for a lightly-equipped traveller.
From Colchis to cross into Media does not take long- there is only a
single intervening nation, the Saspirians, passing whom you find
yourself in Media. This however was not the road followed by the
Scythians, who turned out of the straight course, and took the upper
route, which is much longer, keeping the Caucasus upon their right.
The Scythians, having thus invaded Media, were opposed by the Medes,
who gave them battle, but, being defeated, lost their empire. The
Scythians became masters of Asia.

After this they marched forward with the design of invading Egypt.
When they had reached Palestine, however, Psammetichus the Egyptian
king met them with gifts and prayers, and prevailed on them to advance
no further. On their return, passing through Ascalon, a city of Syria,
the greater part of them went their way without doing any damage;
but some few who lagged behind pillaged the temple of Celestial Venus.
I have inquired and find that the temple at Ascalon is the most
ancient of all the temples to this goddess; for the one in Cyprus,
as the Cyprians themselves admit, was built in imitation of it; and
that in Cythera was erected by the Phoenicians, who belong to this
part of Syria. The Scythians who plundered the temple were punished by
the goddess with the female sickness, which still attaches to their
posterity. They themselves confess that they are afflicted with the
disease for this reason, and travellers who visit Scythia can see what
sort of a disease it is. Those who suffer from it are called Enarees.

The dominion of the Scythians over Asia lasted eight-and-twenty
years, during which time their insolence and oppression spread ruin on
every side. For besides the regular tribute, they exacted from the
several nations additional imposts, which they fixed at pleasure;
and further, they scoured the country and plundered every one of
whatever they could. At length Cyaxares and the Medes invited the
greater part of them to a banquet, and made them drunk with wine,
after which they were all massacred. The Medes then recovered their
empire, and had the same extent of dominion as before. They took
Nineveh- I will relate how in another history- and conquered all
Assyria except the district of Babylonia. After this Cyaxares died,
having reigned over the Medes, if we include the time of the
Scythian rule, forty years.

Astyages, the son of Cyaxares, succeeded to the throne. He had a
daughter who was named Mandane concerning whom he had a wonderful
dream. He dreamt that from her such a stream of water flowed forth
as not only to fill his capital, but to flood the whole of Asia.
This vision he laid before such of the Magi as had the gift of
interpreting dreams, who expounded its meaning to him in full, whereat
he was greatly terrified. On this account, when his daughter was now
of ripe age, he would not give her in marriage to any of the Medes who
were of suitable rank, lest the dream should be accomplished; but he
married her to a Persian of good family indeed, but of a quiet temper,
whom he looked on as much inferior to a Mede of even middle condition.

Thus Cambyses (for so was the Persian called) wedded Mandane,
and took her to his home, after which, in the very first year,
Astyages saw another vision. He fancied that a vine grew from the womb
of his daughter, and overshadowed the whole of Asia. After this dream,
which he submitted also to the interpreters, he sent to Persia and
fetched away Mandane, who was now with child, and was not far from her
time. On her arrival he set a watch over her, intending to destroy the
child to which she should give birth; for the Magian interpreters
had expounded the vision to foreshow that the offspring of his
daughter would reign over Asia in his stead. To guard against this,
Astyages, as soon as Cyrus was born, sent for Harpagus, a man of his
own house and the most faithful of the Medes, to whom he was wont to
entrust all his affairs, and addressed him thus- "Harpagus, I
beseech thee neglect not the business with which I am about to
charge thee; neither betray thou the interests of thy lord for others'
sake, lest thou bring destruction on thine own head at some future
time. Take the child born of Mandane my daughter; carry him with
thee to thy home and slay him there. Then bury him as thou wilt." "Oh!
king," replied the other, "never in time past did Harpagus disoblige
thee in anything, and be sure that through all future time he will
be careful in nothing to offend. If therefore it be thy will that this
thing be done, it is for me to serve thee with all diligence."

When Harpagus had thus answered, the child was given into his
hands, clothed in the garb of death, and he hastened weeping to his
home. There on his arrival he found his wife, to whom he told all that
Astyages had said. "What then," said she, "is it now in thy heart to
do?" "Not what Astyages requires," he answered; "no, he may be
madder and more frantic still than he is now, but I will not be the
man to work his will, or lend a helping hand to such a murder as this.
Many things forbid my slaying him. In the first place the boy is my
own kith and kin; and next Astyages is old, and has no son. If then
when he dies the crown should go to his daughter- that daughter
whose child he now wishes to slay by my hand- what remains for me
but danger of the fearfullest kind? For my own safety, indeed, the
child must die; but some one belonging to Astyages must take his life,
not I or mine."

So saying he sent off a messenger to fetch a certain Mitradates,
one of the herdsmen of Astyages, whose pasturages he knew to be the
fittest for his purpose, lying as they did among mountains infested
with wild beasts. This man was married to one of the king's female
slaves, whose Median name was Spaco, which is in Greek Cyno, since
in the Median tongue the word "Spaca" means a bitch. The mountains, on
the skirts of which his cattle grazed, lie to the north of Agbatana,
towards the Euxine. That part of Media which borders on the Saspirians
is an elevated tract, very mountainous, and covered with forests,
while the rest of the Median territory is entirely level ground. On
the arrival of the herdsman, who came at the hasty summons, Harpagus
said to him- "Astyages requires thee to take this child and lay him in
the wildest part of the hills, where he will be sure to die
speedily. And he bade me tell thee, that if thou dost not kill the
boy, but anyhow allowest him to escape, he will put thee to the most
painful of deaths. I myself am appointed to see the child exposed."

The herdsman on hearing this took the child in his arms, and
went back the way he had come till he reached the folds. There,
providentially, his wife, who had been expecting daily to be put to
bed, had just, during the absence of her husband, been delivered of
a child. Both the herdsman and his wife were uneasy on each other's
account, the former fearful because his wife was so near her time, the
woman alarmed because it was a new thing for her husband to be sent
for by Harpagus. When therefore he came into the house upon his
return, his wife, seeing him arrive so unexpectedly, was the first
to speak, and begged to know why Harpagus had sent for him in such a
hurry. "Wife," said he, "when I got to the town I saw and heard such
things as I would to heaven I had never seen such things as I would to
heaven had never happened to our masters. Every one was weeping in
Harpagus's house. It quite frightened me, but I went in. The moment
I stepped inside, what should I see but a baby lying on the floor,
panting and whimpering, and all covered with gold, and wrapped in
clothes of such beautiful colours. Harpagus saw me, and directly
ordered me to take the child my arms and carry him off, and what was I
to do with him, think you? Why, to lay him in the mountains, where the
wild beasts are most plentiful. And he told me it was the king himself
that ordered it to be done, and he threatened me with such dreadful
things if I failed. So I took the child up in my arms, and carried him
along. I thought it might be the son of one of the household slaves. I
did wonder certainly to see the gold and the beautiful baby-clothes,
and I could not think why there was such a weeping in Harpagus's
house. Well, very soon, as I came along, I got at the truth. They sent
a servant with me to show me the way out of the town, and to leave the
baby in my hands; and he told me that the child's mother is the king's
daughter Mandane, and his father Cambyses, the son of Cyrus; and
that the king orders him to be killed; and look, here the child is."

With this the herdsman uncovered the infant, and showed him to his
wife, who, when she saw him, and observed how fine a child and how
beautiful he was, burst into tears, and clinging to the knees of her
husband, besought him on no account to expose the babe; to which he
answered, that it was not possible for him to do otherwise, as
Harpagus would be sure to send persons to see and report to him, and
he was to suffer a most cruel death if he disobeyed. Failing thus in
her first attempt to persuade her husband, the woman spoke a second
time, saying, "If then there is no persuading thee, and a child must
needs be seen exposed upon the mountains, at least do thus. The
child of which I have just been delivered is stillborn; take it and
lay it on the hills, and let us bring up as our own the child of the
daughter of Astyages. So shalt thou not be charged with unfaithfulness
to thy lord, nor shall we have managed badly for ourselves. Our dead
babe will have a royal funeral, and this living child will not be
deprived of life."

It seemed to the herdsman that this advice was the best under
the circumstances. He therefore followed it without loss of time.
The child which he had intended to put to death he gave over to his
wife, and his own dead child he put in the cradle wherein he had
carried the other, clothing it first in all the other's costly attire,
and taking it in his arms he laid it in the wildest place of all the
mountain-range. When the child had been three days exposed, leaving
one of his helpers to watch the body, he started off for the city, and
going straight to Harpagus's house, declared himself ready to show the
corpse of the boy. Harpagus sent certain of his bodyguard, on whom
he had the firmest reliance, to view the body for him, and,
satisfied with their seeing it, gave orders for the funeral. Thus
was the herdsman's child buried, and the other child, who was
afterwards known by the name of Cyrus, was taken by the herdsman's
wife, and brought up under a different name.

When the boy was in his tenth year, an accident which I will now
relate, caused it to be discovered who he was. He was at play one
day in the village where the folds of the cattle were, along with
the boys of his own age, in the street. The other boys who were
playing with him chose the cowherd's son, as he was called, to be
their king. He then proceeded to order them about some he set to build
him houses, others he made his guards, one of them was to be the
king's eye, another had the office of carrying his messages; all had
some task or other. Among the boys there was one, the son of
Artembares, a Mede of distinction, who refused to do what Cyrus had
set him. Cyrus told the other boys to take him into custody, and
when his orders were obeyed, he chastised him most severely with the
whip. The son of Artembares, as soon as he was let go, full of rage at
treatment so little befitting his rank, hastened to the city and
complained bitterly to his father of what had been done to him by
Cyrus. He did not, of course, say "Cyrus," by which name the boy was
not yet known, but called him the son of the king's cowherd.
Artembares, in the heat of his passion, went to Astyages,
accompanied by his son, and made complaint of the gross injury which
had been done him. Pointing to the boy's shoulders, he exclaimed,
"Thus, oh! king, has thy slave, the son of a cowherd, heaped insult
upon us."

At this sight and these words Astyages, wishing to avenge the
son of Artembares for his father's sake, sent for the cowherd and
his boy. When they came together into his presence, fixing his eyes on
Cyrus, Astyages said, "Hast thou then, the son of so mean a fellow
as that, dared to behave thus rudely to the son of yonder noble, one
of the first in my court?" "My lord," replied the boy, "I only treated
him as he deserved. I was chosen king in play by the boys of our
village, because they thought me the best for it. He himself was one
of the boys who chose me. All the others did according to my orders;
but he refused, and made light of them, until at last he got his due
reward. If for this I deserve to suffer punishment, here I am ready to
submit to it."

While the boy was yet speaking Astyages was struck with a
suspicion who he was. He thought he saw something in the character
of his face like his own, and there was a nobleness about the answer
he had made; besides which his age seemed to tally with the time
when his grandchild was exposed. Astonished at all this, Astyages
could not speak for a while. At last, recovering himself with
difficulty, and wishing to be quit of Artembares, that he might
examine the herdsman alone, he said to the former, "I promise thee,
Artembares, so to settle this business that neither thou nor thy son
shall have any cause to complain." Artembares retired from his
presence, and the attendants, at the bidding of the king, led Cyrus
into an inner apartment. Astyages then being left alone with the
herdsman, inquired of him where he had got the boy, and who had
given him to him; to which he made answer that the lad was his own
child, begotten by himself, and that the mother who bore him was still
alive with him in his house. Astyages remarked that he was very
ill-advised to bring himself into such great trouble, and at the
same time signed to his bodyguard to lay hold of him. Then the
herdsman, as they were dragging him to the rack, began at the
beginning, and told the whole story exactly as it happened, without
concealing anything, ending with entreaties and prayers to the king to
grant him forgiveness.

Astyages, having got the truth of the matter from the herdsman,
was very little further concerned about him, but with Harpagus he
was exceedingly enraged. The guards were bidden to summon him into the
presence, and on his appearance Astyages asked him, "By what death was
it, Harpagus, that thou slewest the child of my daughter whom I gave
into thy hands?" Harpagus, seeing the cowherd in the room, did not
betake himself to lies, lest he should be confuted and proved false,
but replied as follows:- "Sire, when thou gavest the child into my
hands I instantly considered with myself how I could contrive to
execute thy wishes, and yet, while guiltless of any unfaithfulness
towards thee, avoid imbruing my hands in blood which was in truth
thy daughter's and thine own. And this was how I contrived it. I
sent for this cowherd, and gave the child over to him, telling him
that by the king's orders it was to be put to death. And in this I
told no lie, for thou hadst so commanded. Moreover, when I gave him
the child, I enjoined him to lay it somewhere in the wilds of the
mountains, and to stay near and watch till it was dead; and I
threatened him with all manner of punishment if he failed. Afterwards,
when he had done according to all that I commanded him, and the
child had died, I sent some of the most trustworthy of my eunuchs, who
viewed the body for me, and then I had the child buried. This, sire,
is the simple truth, and this is the death by which the child died."

Thus Harpagus related the whole story in a plain,
straightforward way; upon which Astyages, letting no sign escape him
of the anger that he felt, began by repeating to him all that he had
just heard from the cowherd, and then concluded with saying, "So the
boy is alive, and it is best as it is. For the child's fate was a
great sorrow to me, and the reproaches of my daughter went to my
heart. Truly fortune has played us a good turn in this. Go thou home
then, and send thy son to be with the new comer, and to-night, as I
mean to sacrifice thank-offerings for the child's safety to the gods
to whom such honour is due, I look to have thee a guest at the
banquet."

Harpagus, on hearing this, made obeisance, and went home rejoicing
to find that his disobedience had turned out so fortunately, and that,
instead of being punished, he was invited to a banquet given in honour
of the happy occasion. The moment he reached home he called for his
son, a youth of about thirteen, the only child of his parents, and
bade him go to the palace, and do whatever Astyages should direct.
Then, in the gladness of his heart, he went to his wife and told her
all that had happened. Astyages, meanwhile, took the son of
Harpagus, and slew him, after which he cut him in pieces, and
roasted some portions before the fire, and boiled others; and when all
were duly prepared, he kept them ready for use. The hour for the
banquet came, and Harpagus appeared, and with him the other guests,
and all sat down to the feast. Astyages and the rest of the guests had
joints of meat served up to them; but on the table of Harpagus,
nothing was placed except the flesh of his own son. This was all put
before him, except the hands and feet and head, which were laid by
themselves in a covered basket. When Harpagus seemed to have eaten his
fill, Astyages called out to him to know how he had enjoyed the
repast. On his reply that he had enjoyed it excessively, they whose
business it was brought him the basket, in which were the hands and
feet and head of his son, and bade him open it, and take out what he
pleased. Harpagus accordingly uncovered the basket, and saw within
it the remains of his son. The sight, however, did not scare him, or
rob him of his self-possession. Being asked by Astyages if he knew
what beast's flesh it was that he had been eating, he answered that he
knew very well, and that whatever the king did was agreeable. After
this reply, he took with him such morsels of the flesh as were
uneaten, and went home, intending, as I conceive, to collect the
remains and bury them.

Such was the mode in which Astyages punished Harpagus: afterwards,
proceeding to consider what he should do with Cyrus, his grandchild,
he sent for the Magi, who formerly interpreted his dream in the way
which alarmed him so much, and asked them how they had expounded it.
They answered, without varying from what they had said before, that
"the boy must needs be a king if he grew up, and did not die too
soon." Then Astyages addressed them thus: "The boy has escaped, and
lives; he has been brought up in the country, and the lads of the
village where he lives have made him their king. All that kings
commonly do he has done. He has had his guards, and his doorkeepers,
and his messengers, and all the other usual officers. Tell me, then,
to what, think you, does all this tend?" The Magi answered, "If the
boy survives, and has ruled as a king without any craft or
contrivance, in that case we bid thee cheer up, and feel no more alarm
on his account. He will not reign a second time. For we have found
even oracles sometimes fulfilled in an unimportant way; and dreams,
still oftener, have wondrously mean accomplishments." "It is what I
myself most incline to think," Astyages rejoined; "the boy having been
already king, the dream is out, and I have nothing more to fear from
him. Nevertheless, take good heed and counsel me the best you can
for the safety of my house and your own interests." "Truly," said
the Magi in reply, "it very much concerns our interests that thy
kingdom be firmly established; for if it went to this boy it would
pass into foreign hands, since he is a Persian: and then we Medes
should lose our freedom, and be quite despised by the Persians, as
being foreigners. But so long as thou, our fellow-countryman, art on
the throne, all manner of honours are ours, and we are even not
without some share in the government. Much reason therefore have we to
forecast well for thee and for thy sovereignty. If then we saw any
cause for present fear, be sure we would not keep it back from thee.
But truly we are persuaded that the dream has had its accomplishment
in this harmless way; and so our own fears being at rest, we recommend
thee to banish thine. As for the boy, our advice is that thou send him
away to Persia, to his father and mother."

Astyages heard their answer with pleasure, and calling Cyrus
into his presence, said to him, "My child, I was led to do thee a
wrong by a dream which has come to nothing: from that wrong thou
wert saved by thy own good fortune. Go now with a light heart to
Persia; I will provide thy escort. Go, and when thou gettest to thy
journey's end, thou wilt behold thy father and thy mother, quite other
people from Mitradates the cowherd and his wife."

With these words Astyages dismissed his grandchild. On his arrival
at the house of Cambyses, he was received by his parents, who, when
they learnt who he was, embraced him heartily, having always been
convinced that he died almost as soon as he was born. So they asked
him by what means he had chanced to escape; and he told them how
that till lately he had known nothing at all about the matter, but had
been mistaken- oh! so widely!- and how that he had learnt his
history by the way, as he came from Media. He had been quite sure that
he was the son of the king's cowherd, but on the road the king's
escort had told him all the truth; and then he spoke of the
cowherd's wife who had brought him up, and filled his whole talk
with her praises; in all that he had to tell them about himself, it
was always Cyno- Cyno was everything. So it happened that his parents,
catching the name at his mouth, and wishing to persuade the Persians
that there was a special providence in his preservation, spread the
report that Cyrus, when he was exposed, was suckled by a bitch. This
was the sole origin of the rumour.

Afterwards, when Cyrus grew to manhood, and became known as the
bravest and most popular of all his compeers, Harpagus, who was bent
on revenging himself upon Astyages, began to pay him court by gifts
and messages. His own rank was too humble for him to hope to obtain
vengeance without some foreign help. When therefore he saw Cyrus,
whose wrongs were so similar to his own, growing up expressly (as it
were) to be the avenger whom he needed, he set to work to procure
his support and aid in the matter. He had already paved the way for
his designs, by persuading, severally, the great Median nobles, whom
the harsh rule of their monarch had offended, that the best plan would
be to put Cyrus at their head, and dethrone Astyages. These
preparations made, Harpagus, being now ready for revolt, was anxious
to make known his wishes to Cyrus, who still lived in Persia; but as
the roads between Media and Persia were guarded, he had to contrive
a means of sending word secretly, which he did in the following way.
He took a hare, and cutting open its belly without hurting the fur, he
slipped in a letter containing what he wanted to say, and then
carefully sewing up the paunch, he gave the hare to one of his most
faithful slaves, disguising him as a hunter with nets, and sent him
off to Persia to take the game as a present to Cyrus, bidding him tell
Cyrus, by word of mouth, to paunch the animal himself, and let no
one be present at the time.

All was done as he wished, and Cyrus, on cutting the hare open,
found the letter inside, and read as follows:- "Son of Cambyses, the
gods assuredly watch over thee, or never wouldst thou have passed
through thy many wonderful adventures- now is the time when thou mayst
avenge thyself upon Astyages, thy murderer. He willed thy death,
remember; to the gods and to me thou owest that thou art still
alive. I think thou art not ignorant of what he did to thee, nor of
what I suffered at his hands because I committed thee to the
cowherd, and did not put thee to death. Listen now to me, and obey
my words, and all the empire of Astyages shall be thine. Raise the
standard of revolt in Persia, and then march straight on Media.
Whether Astyages appoint me to command his forces against thee, or
whether he appoint any other of the princes of the Medes, all will
go as thou couldst wish. They will be the first to fall away from him,
and joining thy side, exert themselves to overturn his power. Be
sure that on our part all is ready; wherefore do thou thy part, and
that speedily."

Cyrus, on receiving the tidings contained in this letter, set
himself to consider how he might best persuade the Persians to revolt.
After much thought, he hit on the following as the most expedient
course: he wrote what he thought proper upon a roll, and then
calling an assembly of the Persians, he unfolded the roll, and read
out of it that Astyages appointed him their general. "And now," said
he, "since it is so, I command you to go and bring each man his
reaping-hook." With these words he dismissed the assembly.

Now the Persian nation is made up of many tribes. Those which
Cyrus assembled and persuaded to revolt from the Medes were the
principal ones on which all the others are dependent. These are the
Pasargadae, the Maraphians, and the Maspians, of whom the Pasargadae
are the noblest. The Achaemenidae, from which spring all the Perseid
kings, is one of their clans. The rest of the Persian tribes are the
following: the Panthialaeans, the Derusiaeans, the Germanians, who are
engaged in husbandry; the Daans, the Mardians, the Dropicans, and
the Sagartians, who are nomads.

When, in obedience to the orders which they had received, the
Persians came with their reaping-hooks, Cyrus led them to a tract of
ground, about eighteen or twenty furlongs each way, covered with
thorns, and ordered them to clear it before the day was out. They
accomplished their task; upon which he issued a second order to
them, to take the bath the day following, and again come to him.
Meanwhile he collected together all his father's flocks, both sheep
and goats, and all his oxen, and slaughtered them, and made ready to
give an entertainment to the entire Persian army. Wine, too, and bread
of the choicest kinds were prepared for the occasion. When the
morrow came, and the Persians appeared, he bade them recline upon
the grass, and enjoy themselves. After the feast was over, he
requested them to tell him "which they liked best, to-day's work, or
yesterday's?" They answered that "the contrast was indeed strong:
yesterday brought them nothing but what was bad, to-day everything
that was good." Cyrus instantly seized on their reply, and laid bare
his purpose in these words: "Ye men of Persia, thus do matters stand
with you. If you choose to hearken to my words, you may enjoy these
and ten thousand similar delights, and never condescend to any slavish
toil; but if you will not hearken, prepare yourselves for unnumbered
toils as hard as yesterday's. Now therefore follow my bidding, and
be free. For myself I feel that I am destined by Providence to
undertake your liberation; and you, I am sure, are no whit inferior to
the Medes in anything, least of all in bravery. Revolt, therefore,
from Astyages, without a moment's delay."

The Persians, who had long been impatient of the Median
dominion, now that they had found a leader, were delighted to shake
off the yoke. Meanwhile Astyages, informed of the doings of Cyrus,
sent a messenger to summon him to his presence. Cyrus replied, "Tell
Astyages that I shall appear in his presence sooner than he will
like." Astyages, when he received this message, instantly armed all
his subjects, and, as if God had deprived him of his senses, appointed
Harpagus to be their general, forgetting how greatly he had injured
him. So when the two armies met and engaged, only a few of the
Medes, who were not in the secret, fought; others deserted openly to
the Persians; while the greater number counterfeited fear, and fled.

Astyages, on learning the shameful flight and dispersion of his
army, broke out into threats against Cyrus, saying, "Cyrus shall
nevertheless have no reason to rejoice"; and directly he seized the
Magian interpreters, who had persuaded him to allow Cyrus to escape,
and impaled them; after which, he armed all the Medes who had remained
in the city, both young and old; and leading them against the
Persians, fought a battle, in which he was utterly defeated, his
army being destroyed, and he himself falling into the enemy's hands.

Harpagus then, seeing him a prisoner, came near, and exulted
over him with many jibes and jeers. Among other cutting speeches which
he made, he alluded to the supper where the flesh of his son was given
him to eat, and asked Astyages to answer him now, how he enjoyed being
a slave instead of a king? Astyages looked in his face, and asked
him in return, why he claimed as his own the achievements of Cyrus?
"Because," said Harpagus, "it was my letter which made him revolt, and
so I am entitled to all the credit of the enterprise." Then Astyages
declared that "in that case he was at once the silliest and the most
unjust of men: the silliest, if when it was in his power to put the
crown on his own head, as it must assuredly have been, if the revolt
was entirely his doing, he had placed it on the head of another; the
most unjust, if on account of that supper he had brought slavery on
the Medes. For, supposing that he was obliged to invest another with
the kingly power, and not retain it himself, yet justice required that
a Mede, rather than a Persian, should receive the dignity. Now,
however, the Medes, who had been no parties to the wrong of which he
complained, were made slaves instead of lords, and slaves moreover
of those who till recently had been their subjects."

Thus after a reign of thirty-five years, Astyages lost his
crown, and the Medes, in consequence of his cruelty, were brought
under the rule of the Persians. Their empire over the parts of Asia
beyond the Halys had lasted one hundred and twenty-eight years, except
during the time when the Scythians had the dominion. Afterwards the
Medes repented of their submission, and revolted from Darius, but were
defeated in battle, and again reduced to subjection. Now, however,
in the time of Astyages, it was the Persians who under Cyrus
revolted from the Medes, and became thenceforth the rulers of Asia.
Cyrus kept Astyages at his court during the remainder of his life,
without doing him any further injury. Such then were the circumstances
of the birth and bringing up of Cyrus, and such were the steps by
which he mounted the throne. It was at a later date that he was
attacked by Croesus, and overthrew him, as I have related in an
earlier portion of this history. The overthrow of Croesus made him
master of the whole of Asia.

The customs which I know the Persians to observe are the
following: they have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and
consider the use of them a sign of folly. This comes, I think, from
their not believing the gods to have the same nature with men, as
the Greeks imagine. Their wont, however, is to ascend the summits of
the loftiest mountains, and there to offer sacrifice to Jupiter, which
is the name they give to the whole circuit of the firmament. They
likewise offer to the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire, to water,
and to the winds. These are the only gods whose worship has come
down to them from ancient times. At a later period they began the
worship of Urania, which they borrowed from the Arabians and
Assyrians. Mylitta is the name by which the Assyrians know this
goddess, whom the Arabians call Alitta, and the Persians Mitra.

To these gods the Persians offer sacrifice in the following
manner: they raise no altar, light no fire, pour no libations; there
is no sound of the flute, no putting on of chaplets, no consecrated
barley-cake; but the man who wishes to sacrifice brings his victim
to a spot of ground which is pure from pollution, and there calls upon
the name of the god to whom he intends to offer. It is usual to have
the turban encircled with a wreath, most commonly of myrtle. The
sacrificer is not allowed to pray for blessings on himself alone,
but he prays for the welfare of the king, and of the whole Persian
people, among whom he is of necessity included. He cuts the victim
in pieces, and having boiled the flesh, he lays it out upon the
tenderest herbage that he can find, trefoil especially. When all is
ready, one of the Magi comes forward and chants a hymn, which they say
recounts the origin of the gods. It is not lawful to offer sacrifice
unless there is a Magus present. After waiting a short time the
sacrificer carries the flesh of the victim away with him, and makes
whatever use of it he may please.

Of all the days in the year, the one which they celebrate most
is their birthday. It is customary to have the board furnished on that
day with an ampler supply than common. The richer Persians cause an
ox, a horse, a camel, and an ass to be baked whole and so served up to
them: the poorer classes use instead the smaller kinds of cattle. They
eat little solid food but abundance of dessert, which is set on
table a few dishes at a time; this it is which makes them say that
"the Greeks, when they eat, leave off hungry, having nothing worth
mention served up to them after the meats; whereas, if they had more
put before them, they would not stop eating." They are very fond of
wine, and drink it in large quantities. To vomit or obey natural calls
in the presence of another is forbidden among them. Such are their
customs in these matters.

It is also their general practice to deliberate upon affairs of
weight when they are drunk; and then on the morrow, when they are
sober, the decision to which they came the night before is put
before them by the master of the house in which it was made; and if it
is then approved of, they act on it; if not, they set it aside.
Sometimes, however, they are sober at their first deliberation, but in
this case they always reconsider the matter under the influence of
wine.

When they meet each other in the streets, you may know if the
persons meeting are of equal rank by the following token: if they are,
instead of speaking, they kiss each other on the lips. In the case
where one is a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on
the cheek; where the difference of rank is great, the inferior
prostrates himself upon the ground. Of nations, they honour most their
nearest neighbours, whom they esteem next to themselves; those who
live beyond these they honour in the second degree; and so with the
remainder, the further they are removed, the less the esteem in
which they hold them. The reason is that they look upon themselves
as very greatly superior in all respects to the rest of mankind,
regarding others as approaching to excellence in proportion as they
dwell nearer to them; whence it comes to pass that those who are the
farthest off must be the most degraded of mankind. Under the
dominion of the Medes, the several nations of the empire exercised
authority over each other in this order. The Medes were lords over
all, and governed the nations upon their borders, who in their turn
governed the States beyond, who likewise bore rule over the nations
which adjoined on them. And this is the order which the Persians
also follow in their distribution of honour; for that people, like
the Medes, has a progressive scale of administration and government.

There is no nation which so readily adopts foreign customs as
the Persians. Thus, they have taken the dress of the Medes,
considering it superior to their own; and in war they wear the
Egyptian breastplate. As soon as they hear of any luxury, they
instantly make it their own: and hence, among other novelties, they
have learnt unnatural lust from the Greeks. Each of them has several
wives, and a still larger number of concubines.

Next to prowess in arms, it is regarded as the greatest proof of
manly excellence to be the father of many sons. Every year the king
sends rich gifts to the man who can show the largest number: for
they hold that number is strength. Their sons are carefully instructed
from their fifth to their twentieth year, in three things alone,- to
ride, to draw the bow, and to speak the truth. Until their fifth
year they are not allowed to come into the sight of their father,
but pass their lives with the women. This is done that, if the child
die young, the father may not be afflicted by its loss.

To my mind it is a wise rule, as also is the following- that the
king shall not put any one to death for a single fault, and that
none of the Persians shall visit a single fault in a slave with any
extreme penalty; but in every case the services of the offender
shall be set against his misdoings; and, if the latter be found to
outweigh the former, the aggrieved party shall then proceed to
punishment.

The Persians maintain that never yet did any one kill his own
father or mother; but in all such cases they are quite sure that, if
matters were sifted to the bottom, it would be found that the child
was either a changeling or else the fruit of adultery; for it is not
likely, they say, that the real father should perish by the hands of
his child.

They hold it unlawful to talk of anything which it is unlawful
to do. The most disgraceful thing in the world, they think, is to
tell a lie; the next worst, to owe a debt: because, among other
reasons, the debtor is obliged to tell lies. If a Persian has the
leprosy he is not allowed to enter into a city, or to have any
dealings with the other Persians; he must, they say, have sinned
against the sun. Foreigners attacked by this disorder, are forced to
leave the country: even white pigeons are often driven away, as
guilty of the same offence. They never defile a river with the
secretions of their bodies, nor even wash their hands in one; nor
will they allow others to do so, as they have a great reverence for
rivers. There is another peculiarity, which the Persians themselves
have never noticed, but which has not escaped my observation. Their
names, which are expressive of some bodily or mental excellence, all
end with the same letter- the letter which is called San by the
Dorians, and Sigma by the Ionians. Any one who examines will find
that the Persian names, one and all without exception, end with this
letter.

Thus much I can declare of the Persians with entire certainty,
from my own actual knowledge. There is another custom which is
spoken of with reserve, and not openly, concerning their dead. It is
said that the body of a male Persian is never buried, until it has
been torn either by a dog or a bird of prey. That the Magi have this
custom is beyond a doubt, for they practise it without any
concealment. The dead bodies are covered with wax, and then buried
in the ground.

The Magi are a very peculiar race, different entirely from the
Egyptian priests, and indeed from all other men whatsoever. The
Egyptian priests make it a point of religion not to kill any live
animals except those which they offer in sacrifice. The Magi, on the
contrary, kill animals of all kinds with their own hands, excepting
dogs and men. They even seem to take a delight in the employment,
and kill, as readily as they do other animals, ants and snakes, and
such like flying or creeping things. However, since this has always
been their custom, let them keep to it. I return to my former
narrative.

Immediately after the conquest of Lydia by the Persians, the
Ionian and Aeolian Greeks sent ambassadors to Cyrus at Sardis, and
prayed to become his lieges on the footing which they had occupied
under Croesus. Cyrus listened attentively to their proposals, and
answered them by a fable. "There was a certain piper," he said, "who
was walking one day by the seaside, when he espied some fish; so he
began to pipe to them, imagining they would come out to him upon the
land. But as he found at last that his hope was vain, he took a net,
and enclosing a great draught of fishes, drew them ashore. The fish
then began to leap and dance; but the piper said, 'Cease your
dancing now, as you did not choose to come and dance when I piped to
you.'" Cyrus gave this answer to the Ionians and Aeolians, because,
when he urged them by his messengers to revolt from Croesus, they
refused; but now, when his work was done, they came to offer their
allegiance. It was in anger, therefore, that he made them this
reply. The Ionians, on hearing it, set to work to fortify their towns,
and held meetings at the Panionium, which were attended by all
excepting the Milesians, with whom Cyrus had concluded a separate
treaty, by which he allowed them the terms they had formerly
obtained from Croesus. The other Ionians resolved, with one accord, to
send ambassadors to Sparta to implore assistance.

Now the Ionians of Asia, who meet at the Panionium, have built
their cities in a region where the air and climate are the most
beautiful in the whole world: for no other region is equally blessed
with Ionia, neither above it nor below it, nor east nor west of it.
For in other countries either the climate is over cold and damp, or
else the heat and drought are sorely oppressive. The Ionians do not
all speak the same language, but use in different places four
different dialects. Towards the south their first city is Miletus,
next to which lie Myus and Priene; all these three are in Caria and
have the same dialect. Their cities in Lydia are the following:
Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, Clazomenae, and Phocaea. The
inhabitants of these towns have none of the peculiarities of speech
which belong to the three first-named cities, but use a dialect of
their own. There remain three other Ionian towns, two situate in
isles, namely, Samos and Chios; and one upon the mainland, which is
Erythrae. Of these Chios and Erythrae have the same dialect, while
Samos possesses a language peculiar to itself. Such are the four
varieties of which I spoke.

Of the Ionians at this period, one people, the Milesians, were
in no danger of attack, as Cyrus had received them into alliance.
The islanders also had as yet nothing to fear, since Phoenicia was
still independent of Persia, and the Persians themselves were not a
seafaring people. The Milesians had separated from the common cause
solely on account of the extreme weakness of the Ionians: for,
feeble as the power of the entire Hellenic race was at that time, of
all its tribes the Ionic was by far the feeblest and least esteemed,
not possessing a single State of any mark excepting Athens. The
Athenians and most of the other Ionic States over the world, went so
far in their dislike of the name as actually to lay it aside; and even
at the present day the greater number of them seem to me to be ashamed
of it. But the twelve cities in Asia have always gloried in the
appellation; they gave the temple which they built for themselves
the name of the Panionium, and decreed that it should not be open to
any of the other Ionic States; no State, however, except Smyrna, has
craved admission to it.

In the same way the Dorians of the region which is now called
the Pentapolis, but which was formerly known as the Doric Hexapolis,
exclude all their Dorian neighbours from their temple, the Triopium:
nay, they have even gone so far as to shut out from it certain of
their own body who were guilty of an offence against the customs of
the place. In the games which were anciently celebrated in honour of
the Triopian Apollo, the prizes given to the victors were tripods of
brass; and the rule was that these tripods should not be carried
away from the temple, but should then and there be dedicated to the
god. Now a man of Halicarnassus, whose name was Agasicles, being
declared victor in the games, in open contempt of the law, took the
tripod home to his own house and there hung it against the wall. As
a punishment for this fault, the five other cities, Lindus,
Ialyssus, Cameirus, Cos, and Cnidus, deprived the sixth city,
Halicarnassus, of the right of entering the temple.

The Ionians founded twelve cities in Asia, and refused to
enlarge the number, on account (as I imagine) of their having been
divided into twelve States when they lived in the Peloponnese; just as
the Achaeans, who drove them out, are at the present day. The first
city of the Achaeans after Sicyon, is Pellene, next to which are
Aegeira, Aegae upon the Crathis, a stream which is never dry, and from
which the Italian Crathis received its name,- Bura, Helice- where
the Ionians took refuge on their defeat by the Achaean invaders-
Aegium, Rhypes, Patreis, Phareis, Olenus on the Peirus, which is a
large river- Dyme and Tritaeeis, all sea-port towns except the last
two, which lie up the country.

These are the twelve divisions of what is now Achaea, and was
formerly Ionia; and it was owing to their coming from a country so
divided that the Ionians, on reaching Asia, founded their twelve
States: for it is the height of folly to maintain that these Ionians
are more Ionian than the rest, or in any respect better born, since
the truth is that no small portion of them were Abantians from Euboea,
who are not even Ionians in name; and, besides, there were mixed up
with the emigration Minyae from Orchomenus, Cadmeians, Dryopians,
Phocians from the several cities of Phocis, Molossians, Arcadian
Pelasgi, Dorians from Epidaurus, and many other distinct tribes.
Even those who came from the Prytaneum of Athens, and reckon
themselves the purest Ionians of all, brought no wives with them to
the new country, but married Carian girls, whose fathers they had
slain. Hence these women made a law, which they bound themselves by an
oath to observe, and which they handed down to their daughters after
them, "That none should ever sit at meat with her husband, or call him
by his name"; because the invaders slew their fathers, their husbands,
and their sons, and then forced them to become their wives. It was
at Miletus that these events took place.

The kings, too, whom they set over them, were either Lycians, of
the blood of Glaucus, son of Hippolochus, or Pylian Caucons of the
blood of Codrus, son of Melanthus; or else from both those families.
But since these Ionians set more store by the name than any of the
others, let them pass for the pure-bred Ionians; though truly all
are Ionians who have their origin from Athens, and keep the
Apaturia. This is a festival which all the Ionians celebrate, except
the Ephesians and the Colophonians, whom a certain act of bloodshed
excludes from it.

The Panionium is a place in Mycale, facing the north, which was
chosen by the common voice of the Ionians and made sacred to
Heliconian Neptune. Mycale itself is a promontory of the mainland,
stretching out westward towards Samos, in which the Ionians assemble
from all their States to keep the feast of the Panionia. The names
of festivals, not only among the Ionians but among all the Greeks,
end, like the Persian proper names, in one and the same letter.

The above-mentioned, then, are the twelve towns of the Ionians.
The Aeolic cities are the following:- Cyme, called also Phriconis,
Larissa, Neonteichus, Temnus, Cilla, Notium, Aegiroessa, Pitane,
Aegaeae, Myrina, and Gryneia. These are the eleven ancient cities of
the Aeolians. Originally, indeed, they had twelve cities upon the
mainland, like the Ionians, but the Ionians deprived them of Smyrna,
one of the number. The soil of Aeolis is better than that of Ionia,
but the climate is less agreeable.

The following is the way in which the loss of Smyrna happened.
Certain men of Colophon had been engaged in a sedition there, and
being the weaker party, were driven by the others into banishment. The
Smyrnaeans received the fugitives, who, after a time, watching their
opportunity, while the inhabitants were celebrating a feast to Bacchus
outside the walls, shut to the gates, and so got possession of the
town. The Aeolians of the other States came to their aid, and terms
were agreed on between the parties, the Ionians consenting to give
up all the moveables, and the Aeolians making a surrender of the
place. The expelled Smyrnaeans were distributed among the other States
of the Aeolians, and were everywhere admitted to citizenship.

These, then, were all the Aeolic cities upon the mainland, with
the exception of those about Mount Ida, which made no part of this
confederacy. As for the islands, Lesbos contains five cities.
Arisba, the sixth, was taken by the Methymnaeans, their kinsmen, and
the inhabitants reduced to slavery. Tenedos contains one city, and
there is another which is built on what are called the Hundred
Isles. The Aeolians of Lesbos and Tenedos, like the Ionian
islanders, had at this time nothing to fear. The other Aeolians
decided in their common assembly to follow the Ionians, whatever
course they should pursue.

When the deputies of the Ionians and Aeolians, who had journeyed
with all speed to Sparta, reached the city, they chose one of their
number, Pythermus, a Phocaean, to be their spokesman. In order to draw
together as large an audience as possible, he clothed himself in a
purple garment, and so attired stood forth to speak. In a long
discourse he besought the Spartans to come to the assistance of his
countrymen, but they were not to be persuaded, and voted against
sending any succour. The deputies accordingly went their way, while
the Lacedaemonians, notwithstanding the refusal which they had given
to the prayer of the deputation, despatched a penteconter to the
Asiatic coast with certain Spartans on board, for the purpose, as I
think, of watching Cyrus and Ionia. These men, on their arrival at
Phocaea, sent to Sardis Lacrines, the most distinguished of their
number, to prohibit Cyrus, in the name of the Lacedaemonians, from
offering molestation to any city of Greece, since they would not allow
it.

Cyrus is said, on hearing the speech of the herald, to have
asked some Greeks who were standing by, "Who these Lacedaemonians
were, and what was their number, that they dared to send him such a
notice?" When he had received their reply, he turned to the Spartan
herald and said, "I have never yet been afraid of any men, who have
a set place in the middle of their city, where they come together to
cheat each other and forswear themselves. If I live, the Spartans
shall have troubles enough of their own to talk of, without concerning
themselves about the Ionians." Cyrus intended these words as a
reproach against all the Greeks, because of their having market-places
where they buy and sell, which is a custom unknown to the Persians,
who never make purchases in open marts, and indeed have not in their
whole country a single market-place.

After this interview Cyrus quitted Sardis, leaving the city
under the charge of Tabalus, a Persian, but appointing Pactyas, a
native, to collect the treasure belonging to Croesus and the other
Lydians, and bring after him. Cyrus himself proceeded towards
Agbatana, carrying Croesus along with him, not regarding the Ionians
as important enough to be his immediate object. Larger designs were in
his mind. He wished to war in person against Babylon, the Bactrians,
the Sacae, and Egypt; he therefore determined to assign to one of
his generals the task of conquering the Ionians.

No sooner, however, was Cyrus gone from Sardis than Pactyas
induced his countrymen to rise in open revolt against him and his
deputy Tabalus. With the vast treasures at his disposal he then went
down to the sea, and employed them in hiring mercenary troops, while
at the same time he engaged the people of the coast to enrol
themselves in his army. He then marched upon Sardis, where he besieged
Tabalus, who shut himself up in the citadel.

When Cyrus, on his way to Agbatana, received these tidings, he
returned to Croesus and said, "Where will all this end, Croesus,
thinkest thou? It seemeth that these Lydians will not cease to cause
trouble both to themselves and others. I doubt me if it were not
best to sell them all for slaves. Methinks what I have now done is
as if a man were to 'kill the father and then spare the child.'
Thou, who wert something more than a father to thy people, I have
seized and carried off, and to that people I have entrusted their
city. Can I then feel surprise at their rebellion?" Thus did Cyrus open
to Croesus his thoughts; whereat the latter, full of alarm lest
Cyrus should lay Sardis in ruins, replied as follows: "Oh! my king,
thy words are reasonable; but do not, I beseech thee, give full vent
to thy anger, nor doom to destruction an ancient city, guiltless alike
of the past and of the present trouble. I caused the one, and in my
own person now pay the forfeit. Pactyas has caused the other, he to
whom thou gavest Sardis in charge; let him bear the punishment. Grant,
then, forgiveness to the Lydians, and to make sure of their never
rebelling against thee, or alarming thee more, send and forbid them to
keep any weapons of war, command them to wear tunics under their
cloaks, and to put buskins upon their legs, and make them bring up
their sons to cithern-playing, harping, and shop-keeping. So wilt thou
soon see them become women instead of men, and there will be no more
fear of their revolting from thee."

Croesus thought the Lydians would even so be better off than if
they were sold for slaves, and therefore gave the above advice to
Cyrus, knowing that, unless he brought forward some notable
suggestion, he would not be able to persuade him to alter his mind. He
was likewise afraid lest, after escaping the danger which now pressed,
the Lydians at some future time might revolt from the Persians and
so bring themselves to ruin. The advice pleased Cyrus, who consented
to forego his anger and do as Croesus had said. Thereupon he
summoned to his presence a certain Mede, Mazares by name, and
charged him to issue orders to the Lydians in accordance with the
terms of Croesus' discourse. Further, he commanded him to sell for
slaves all who had joined the Lydians in their attack upon Sardis, and
above aught else to be sure that he brought Pactyas with him alive
on his return. Having given these orders Cyrus continued his journey
towards the Persian territory.

Pactyas, when news came of the near approach of the army sent
against him, fled in terror to Cyme. Mazares, therefore, the Median
general, who had marched on Sardis with a detachment of the army of
Cyrus, finding on his arrival that Pactyas and his troops were gone,
immediately entered the town. And first of all he forced the Lydians
to obey the orders of his master, and change (as they did from that
time) their entire manner of living. Next, he despatched messengers to
Cyme, and required to have Pactyas delivered up to him. On this the
Cymaeans resolved to send to Branchidae and ask the advice of the god.
Branchidae is situated in the territory of Miletus, above the port
of Panormus. There was an oracle there, established in very ancient
times, which both the Ionians and Aeolians were wont often to consult.

Hither therefore the Cymaeans sent their deputies to make
inquiry at the shrine, "What the gods would like them to do with the
Lydian, Pactyas?" The oracle told them, in reply, to give him up to
the Persians. With this answer the messengers returned, and the people
of Cymd were ready to surrender him accordingly; but as they were
preparing to do so, Aristodicus, son of Heraclides, a citizen of
distinction, hindered them. He declared that he distrusted the
response, and believed that the messengers had reported it falsely;
until at last another embassy, of which Aristodicus himself made part,
was despatched, to repeat the former inquiry concerning Pactyas.

On their arrival at the shrine of the god, Aristodicus, speaking
on behalf of the whole body, thus addressed the oracle: "Oh! king,
Pactyas the Lydian, threatened by the Persians with a violent death,
has come to us for sanctuary, and lo, they ask him at our hands,
calling upon our nation to deliver him up. Now, though we greatly
dread the Persian power, yet have we not been bold to give up our
suppliant, till we have certain knowledge of thy mind, what thou
wouldst have us to do." The oracle thus questioned gave the same
answer as before, bidding them surrender Pactyas to the Persians;
whereupon Aristodicus, who had come prepared for such an answer,
proceeded to make the circuit of the temple, and to take all the nests
of young sparrows and other birds that he could find about the
building. As he was thus employed, a voice, it is said, came forth
from the inner sanctuary, addressing Aristodicus in these words: "Most
impious of men, what is this thou hast the face to do? Dost thou
tear my suppliants from my temple?" Aristodicus, at no loss for a
reply, rejoined, "Oh, king, art thou so ready to protect thy
suppliants, and dost thou command the Cymaeans to give up a
suppliant?" "Yes," returned the god, "I do command it, that so for the
impiety you may the sooner perish, and not come here again to
consult my oracle about the surrender of suppliants."

On the receipt of this answer the Cymaeans, unwilling to bring the
threatened destruction on themselves by giving up the man, and
afraid of having to endure a siege if they continued to harbour him,
sent Pactyas away to Mytilene. On this Mazares despatched envoys to
the Mytilenaeans to demand the fugitive of them, and they were
preparing to give him up for a reward (I cannot say with certainty how
large, as the bargain was not completed), when the Cymaeans hearing
what the Mytilenaeans were about, sent a vessel to Lesbos, and
conveyed away Pactyas to Chios. From hence it was that he was
surrendered. The Chians dragged him from the temple of Minerva
Poliuchus and gave him up to the Persians, on condition of receiving
the district of Atarneus, a tract of Mysia opposite to Lesbos, as
the price of the surrender. Thus did Pactyas fall into the hands of
his pursuers, who kept a strict watch upon him that they might be able
to produce him before Cyrus. For a long time afterwards none of the
Chians would use the barley of Atarneus to place on the heads of
victims, or make sacrificial cakes of the corn grown there, but the
whole produce of the land was excluded from all their temples.

Meanwhile Mazares, after he had recovered Pactyas from the Chians,
made war upon those who had taken part in the attack on Tabalus, and
in the first place took Priene and sold the inhabitants for slaves,
after which he overran the whole plain of the Maeander and the
district of Magnesia, both of which he gave up for pillage to the
soldiery. He then suddenly sickened and died.

Upon his death Harpagus was sent down to the coast to succeed to
his command. He also was of the race of the Medes, being the man
whom the Median king, Astyages, feasted at the unholy banquet, and who
lent his aid to Place Cyrus upon the throne. Appointed by Cyrus to
conduct the war in these parts, he entered Ionia, and took the
cities by means of mounds. Forcing the enemy to shut themselves up
within their defences, he heaped mounds of earth against their
walls, and thus carried the towns. Phocaea was the city against
which he directed his first attack.

Now the Phocaeans were the first of the Greeks who performed
long voyages, and it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with
the Adriatic and with Tyrrhenia, with Iberia, and the city of
Tartessus. The vessel which they used in their voyages was not the
round-built merchant-ship, but the long penteconter. On their
arrival at Tartessus, the king of the country, whose name was
Arganthonius, took a liking to them. This monarch reigned over the
Tartessians for eighty years, and lived to be a hundred and twenty
years old. He regarded the Phocaeans with so much favour as, at first,
to beg them to quit Ionia and settle in whatever part of his country
they liked. Afterwards, finding that he could not prevail upon them to
agree to this, and hearing that the Mede was growing great in their
neighbourhood, he gave them money to build a wall about their town,
and certainly he must have given it with a bountiful hand, for the
town is many furlongs in circuit, and the wall is built entirely of
great blocks of stone skilfully fitted together. The wall, then, was
built by his aid.

Harpagus, having advanced against the Phocaeans with his army,
laid siege to their city, first, however, offering them terms. "It
would content him," he said, "if the Phocaeans would agree to throw
down one of their battlements, and dedicate one dwelling-house to
the king." The Phocaeans, sorely vexed at the thought of becoming
slaves, asked a single day to deliberate on the answer they should
return, and besought Harpagus during that day to draw off his forces
from the walls. Harpagus replied, "that he understood well enough what
they were about to do, but nevertheless he would grant their request."
Accordingly the troops were withdrawn, and the Phocaeans forthwith
took advantage of their absence to launch their penteconters, and
put on board their wives and children, their household goods, and even
the images of their gods, with all the votive offerings from the fanes
except the paintings and the works in stone or brass, which were
left behind. With the rest they embarked, and putting to sea, set sail
for Chios. The Persians, on their return, took possession of an
empty town.

Arrived at Chios, the Phocaeans made offers for the purchase of
the islands called the Oenussae, but the Chians refused to part with
them, fearing lest the Phocaeans should establish a factory there, and
exclude their merchants from the commerce of those seas. On their
refusal, the Phocaeans, as Arganthonius was now dead, made up their
minds to sail to Cyrnus (Corsica), where, twenty years before,
following the direction of an oracle, they had founded a city, which
was called Alalia. Before they set out, however, on this voyage,
they sailed once more to Phocaea, and surprising the Persian troops
appointed by Harpagus to garrison town, put them all to the sword.
After this laid the heaviest curses on the man who should draw back
and forsake the armament; and having dropped a heavy mass of iron into
the sea, swore never to return to Phocaea till that mass reappeared
upon the surface. Nevertheless, as they were preparing to depart for
Cyrnus, more than half of their number were seized with such sadness
and so great a longing to see once more their city and their ancient
homes, that they broke the oath by which they had bound themselves and
sailed back to Phocaea.

The rest of the Phocaeans who kept their oath, proceeded without
stopping upon their voyage, and when they came to Cyrnus established
themselves along with the earlier settlers at Alalia and built temples
in the place. For five years they annoyed their neighbours by
plundering and pillaging on all sides, until at length the
Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians leagued against them, and sent each a
fleet of sixty ships to attack the town. The Phocaeans, on their part,
manned all their vessels, sixty in number, and met their enemy on
the Sardinian sea. In the engagement which followed the Phocaeans were
victorious, but their success was only a sort of Cadmeian victory.'
They lost forty ships in the battle, and the twenty which remained
came out of the engagement with beaks so bent and blunted as to be
no longer serviceable. The Phocaeans therefore sailed back again to
Alalia, and taking their wives and children on board, with such
portion of their goods and chattels as the vessels could bear, bade
adieu to Cyrnus and sailed to Rhegium.

The Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians, who had got into their hands
many more than the Phocaeans from among the crews of the forty vessels
that were destroyed, landed their captives upon the coast after the
fight, and stoned them all to death. Afterwards, when sheep, or
oxen, or even men of the district of Agylla passed by the spot where
the murdered Phocaeans lay, their bodies became distorted, or they
were seized with palsy, or they lost the use of some of their limbs.
On this the people of Agylla sent to Delphi to ask the oracle how they
might expiate their sin. The answer of the Pythoness required them
to institute the custom, which they still observe, of honouring the
dead Phocaeans with magnificent funeral rites, and solemn games,
both gymnic and equestrian. Such, then, was the fate that befell the
Phocaean prisoners. The other Phocaeans, who had fled to Rhegium,
became after a while the founders of the city called Vela, in the
district of Oenotria. This city they colonised, upon the showing of
a man of Posidonia, who suggested that the oracle had not meant to bid
them set up a town in Cyrnus the island, but set up the worship of
Cyrnus the hero.

Thus fared it with the men of the city of Phocaea in Ionia. They
of Teos did and suffered almost the same; for they too, when
Harpagus had raised his mound to the height of their defences, took
ship, one and all, and sailing across the sea to Thrace, founded there
the city of Abdera. The site was one which Timesius of Clazomenae
had previously tried to colonise, but without any lasting success, for
he was expelled by the Thracians. Still the Teians of Abdera worship
him to this day as a hero.

Of all the Ionians these two states alone, rather than submit to
slavery, forsook their fatherland. The others (I except Miletus)
resisted Harpagus no less bravely than those who fled their country,
and performed many feats of arms, each fighting in their own
defence, but one after another they suffered defeat; the cities were
taken, and the inhabitants submitted, remaining in their respective
countries, and obeying the behests of their new lords. Miletus, as I
have already mentioned, had made terms with Cyrus, and so continued at
peace. Thus was continental Ionia once more reduced to servitude;
and when the Ionians of the islands saw their brethren upon the
mainland subjugated, they also, dreading the like, gave themselves
up to Cyrus.

It was while the Ionians were in this distress, but still, amid it
all, held their meetings, as of old, at the Panionium, that Bias of
Priene, who was present at the festival, recommended (as I am
informed) a project of the very highest wisdom, which would, had it
been embraced, have enabled the Ionians to become the happiest and
most flourishing of the Greeks. He exhorted them "to join in one body,
set sail for Sardinia, and there found a single Pan-Ionic city; so
they would escape from slavery and rise to great fortune, being
masters of the largest island in the world, exercising dominion even
beyond its bounds; whereas if they stayed in Ionia, he saw no prospect
of their ever recovering their lost freedom." Such was the counsel
which Bias gave the Ionians in their affliction. Before their
misfortunes began, Thales, a man of Miletus, of Phoenician descent,
had recommended a different plan. He counselled them to establish a
single seat of government, and pointed out Teos as the fittest place
for it; "for that," he said, "was the centre of Ionia. Their other
cities might still continue to enjoy their own laws, just as if they
were independent states." This also was good advice.

After conquering the Ionians, Harpagus proceeded to attack the
Carians, the Caunians, and the Lycians. The Ionians and Aeolians
were forced to serve in his army. Now, of the above nations the
Carians are a race who came into the mainland from the islands. In
ancient times they were subjects of king Minos, and went by the name
of Leleges, dwelling among the isles, and, so far as I have been
able to push my inquiries, never liable to give tribute to any man.
They served on board the ships of king Minos whenever he required; and
thus, as he was a great conqueror and prospered in his wars, the
Carians were in his day the most famous by far of all the nations of
the earth. They likewise were the inventors of three things, the use
of which was borrowed from them by the Greeks; they were the first
to fasten crests on helmets and to put devices on shields, and they
also invented handles for shields. In the earlier times shields were
without handles, and their wearers managed them by the aid of a
leathern thong, by which they were slung round the neck and left
shoulder. Long after the time of Minos, the Carians were driven from
the islands by the Ionians and Dorians, and so settled upon the
mainland. The above is the account which the Cretans give of the
Carians: the Carians themselves say very differently. They maintain
that they are the aboriginal inhabitants of the part of the mainland
where they now dwell, and never had any other name than that which
they still bear; and in proof of this they show an ancient temple of
Carian Jove in the country of the Mylasians, in which the Mysians
and Lydians have the right of worshipping, as brother races to the
Carians: for Lydus and Mysus, they say, were brothers of Car. These
nations, therefore, have the aforesaid right; but such as are of a
different race, even though they have come to use the Carian tongue,
are excluded from this temple.

The Caunians, in my judgment, are aboriginals; but by their own
account they came from Crete. In their language, either they have
approximated to the Carians, or the Carians to them- on this point I
cannot speak with certainty. In their customs, however, they differ
greatly from the Carians, and not only so, but from all other men.
They think it a most honourable practice for friends or persons of the
same age, whether they be men, women, or children, to meet together in
large companies, for the purpose of drinking wine. Again, on one
occasion they determined that they would no longer make use of the
foreign temples which had been long established among them, but
would worship their own old ancestral gods alone. Then their whole
youth took arms, and striking the air with their spears, marched to
the Calyndic frontier, declaring that they were driving out the
foreign gods.

The Lycians are in good truth anciently from Crete; which
island, in former days, was wholly peopled with barbarians. A
quarrel arising there between the two sons of Europa, Sarpedon and
Minos, as to which of them should be king, Minos, whose party
prevailed, drove Sarpedon and his followers into banishment. The
exiles sailed to Asia, and landed on the Milyan territory. Milyas
was the ancient name of the country now inhabited by the Lycians:
the Milyae of the present day were, in those times, called Solymi.
So long as Sarpedon reigned, his followers kept the name which they
brought with them from Crete, and were called Termilae, as the Lycians
still are by those who live in their neighbourhood. But after Lycus,
the son of Pandion, banished from Athens by his brother Aegeus had
found a refuge with Sarpedon in the country of these Termilae, they
came, in course of time, to be called from him Lycians. Their
customs are partly Cretan, partly Carian. They have, however, one
singular custom in which they differ from every other nation in the
world. They take the mother's and not the father's name. Ask a
Lycian who he is, and he answers by giving his own name, that of his
mother, and so on in the female line. Moreover, if a free woman
marry a man who is a slave, their children are full citizens; but if a
free man marry a foreign woman, or live with a concubine, even
though he be the first person in the State, the children forfeit all
the rights of citizenship.

Of these nations, the Carians submitted to Harpagus without
performing any brilliant exploits. Nor did the Greeks who dwelt in
Caria behave with any greater gallantry. Among them were the Cnidians,
colonists from Lacedaemon, who occupy a district facing the sea, which
is called Triopium. This region adjoins upon the Bybassian Chersonese;
and, except a very small space, is surrounded by the sea, being
bounded on the north by the Ceramic Gulf, and on the south by the
channel towards the islands of Syme and Rhodes. While Harpagus was
engaged in the conquest of Ionia, the Cnidians, wishing to make
their country an island, attempted to cut through this narrow neck
of land, which was no more than five furlongs across from sea to
sea. Their whole territory lay inside the isthmus; for where Cnidia
ends towards the mainland, the isthmus begins which they were now
seeking to cut through. The work had been commenced, and many hands
were employed upon it, when it was observed that there seemed to be
something unusual and unnatural in the number of wounds that the
workmen received, especially about their eyes, from the splintering of
the rock. The Cnidians, therefore, sent to Delphi, to inquire what
it was that hindered their efforts; and received, according to their
own account, the following answer from the oracle:-

> Fence not the isthmus off, nor dig it through-  
> Jove would have made an island, had he wished.

So the Cnidians ceased digging, and when Harpagus advanced with his
army, they gave themselves up to him without striking a blow.

Above Halicarnassus and further from the coast, were the
Pedasians. With this people, when any evil is about to befall either
themselves or their neighbours, the priestess of Minerva grows an
ample beard. Three times has this marvel happened. They alone, of
all the dwellers in Caria, resisted Harpagus for a while, and gave him
much trouble, maintaining themselves in a certain mountain called
Lida, which they had fortified; but in course of time they also were
forced to submit.

When Harpagus, after these successes, led his forces into the
Xanthian plain, the Lycians of Xanthus went out to meet him in the
field: though but a small band against a numerous host, they engaged
in battle, and performed many glorious exploits. Overpowered at
last, and forced within their walls, they collected into the citadel
their wives and children, all their treasures, and their slaves; and
having so done, fired the building, and burnt it to the ground.
After this, they bound themselves together by dreadful oaths, and
sallying forth against the enemy, died sword in hand, not one
escaping. Those Lycians who now claim to be Xanthians, are foreign
immigrants, except eighty families, who happened to be absent from the
country, and so survived the others. Thus was Xanthus taken by
Harpagus, and Caunus fell in like manner into his hands; for the
Caunians in the main followed the example of the Lycians.

While the lower parts of Asia were in this way brought under by
Harpagus, Cyrus in person subjected the upper regions, conquering
every nation, and not suffering one to escape. Of these conquests I
shall pass by the greater portion, and give an account of those only
which gave him the most trouble, and are the worthiest of mention.
When he had brought all the rest of the continent under his sway, he
made war on the Assyrians.

Assyria possesses a vast number of great cities, whereof the
most renowned and strongest at this time was Babylon, whither, after
the fall of Nineveh, the seat of government had been removed. The
following is a description of the place:- The city stands on a broad
plain, and is an exact square, a hundred and twenty furlongs in length
each way, so that the entire circuit is four hundred and eighty
furlongs. While such is its size, in magnificence there is no other
city that approaches to it. It is surrounded, in the first place, by a
broad and deep moat, full of water, behind which rises a wall fifty
royal cubits in width, and two hundred in height. (The royal cubit
is longer by three fingers' breadth than the common cubit.)

And here I may not omit to tell the use to which the mould dug out
of the great moat was turned, nor the manner wherein the wall was
wrought. As fast as they dug the moat the soil which they got from the
cutting was made into bricks, and when a sufficient number were
completed they baked the bricks in kilns. Then they set to building,
and began with bricking the borders of the moat, after which they
proceeded to construct the wall itself, using throughout for their
cement hot bitumen, and interposing a layer of wattled reeds at
every thirtieth course of the bricks. On the top, along the edges of
the wall, they constructed buildings of a single chamber facing one
another, leaving between them room for a four-horse chariot to turn.
In the circuit of the wall are a hundred gates, all of brass, with
brazen lintels and side-posts. The bitumen used in the work was
brought to Babylon from the Is, a small stream which flows into the
Euphrates at the point where the city of the same name stands, eight
days' journey from Babylon. Lumps of bitumen are found in great
abundance in this river.

The city is divided into two portions by the river which runs
through the midst of it. This river is the Euphrates, a broad, deep,
swift stream, which rises in Armenia, and empties itself into the
Erythraean sea. The city wall is brought down on both sides to the
edge of the stream: thence, from the corners of the wall, there is
carried along each bank of the river a fence of burnt bricks. The
houses are mostly three and four stories high; the streets all run
in straight lines, not only those parallel to the river, but also
the cross streets which lead down to the water-side. At the river
end of these cross streets are low gates in the fence that skirts
the stream, which are, like the great gates in the outer wall, of
brass, and open on the water.

The outer wall is the main defence of the city. There is, however,
a second inner wall, of less thickness than the first, but very little
inferior to it in strength. The centre of each division of the town
was occupied by a fortress. In the one stood the palace of the
kings, surrounded by a wall of great strength and size: in the other
was the sacred precinct of Jupiter Belus, a square enclosure two
furlongs each way, with gates of solid brass; which was also remaining
in my time. In the middle of the precinct there was a tower of solid
masonry, a furlong in length and breadth, upon which was raised a
second tower, and on that a third, and so on up to eight. The ascent
to the top is on the outside, by a path which winds round all the
towers. When one is about half-way up, one finds a resting-place and
seats, where persons are wont to sit some time on their way to the
summit. On the topmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside
the temple stands a couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a
golden table by its side. There is no statue of any kind set up in the
place, nor is the chamber occupied of nights by any one but a single
native woman, who, as the Chaldaeans, the priests of this god, affirm,
is chosen for himself by the deity out of all the women of the land.

They also declare- but I for my part do not credit it- that the
god comes down in person into this chamber, and sleeps upon the couch.
This is like the story told by the Egyptians of what takes place in
their city of Thebes, where a woman always passes the night in the
temple of the Theban Jupiter. In each case the woman is said to be
debarred all intercourse with men. It is also like the custom of
Patara, in Lycia, where the priestess who delivers the oracles, during
the time that she is so employed- for at Patara there is not always an
oracle- is shut up in the temple every night.

Below, in the same precinct, there is a second temple, in which is
a sitting figure of Jupiter, all of gold. Before the figure stands a
large golden table, and the throne whereon it sits, and the base on
which the throne is placed, are likewise of gold. The Chaldaeans
told me that all the gold together was eight hundred talents'
weight. Outside the temple are two altars, one of solid gold, on which
it is only lawful to offer sucklings; the other a common altar, but of
great size, on which the full-grown animals are sacrificed. It is also
on the great altar that the Chaldaeans burn the frankincense, which is
offered to the amount of a thousand talents' weight, every year, at
the festival of the God. In the time of Cyrus there was likewise in
this temple a figure of a man, twelve cubits high, entirely of solid
gold. I myself did not see this figure, but I relate what the
Chaldaeans report concerning it. Darius, the son of Hystaspes, plotted
to carry the statue off, but had not the hardihood to lay his hands
upon it. Xerxes, however, the son of Darius, killed the priest who
forbade him to move the statue, and took it away. Besides the
ornaments which I have mentioned, there are a large number of
private offerings in this holy precinct.

Many sovereigns have ruled over this city of Babylon, and lent
their aid to the building of its walls and the adornment of its
temples, of whom I shall make mention in my Assyrian history. Among
them two were women. Of these, the earlier, called Semiramis, held the
throne five generations before the later princess. She raised
certain embankments well worthy of inspection, in the plain near
Babylon, to control the river, which, till then, used to overflow, and
flood the whole country round about.

The later of the two queens, whose name was Nitocris, a wiser
princess than her predecessor, not only left behind her, as
memorials of her occupancy of the throne, the works which I shall
presently describe, but also, observing the great power and restless
enterprise of the Medes, who had taken so large a number of cities,
and among them Nineveh, and expecting to be attacked in her turn, made
all possible exertions to increase the defences of her empire. And
first, whereas the river Euphrates, which traverses the city, ran
formerly with a straight course to Babylon, she, by certain
excavations which she made at some distance up the stream, rendered it
so winding that it comes three several times in sight of the same
village, a village in Assyria, which is called Ardericea; and to
this day, they who would go from our sea to Babylon, on descending
to the river touch three times, and on three different days, at this
very place. She also made an embankment along each side of the
Euphrates, wonderful both for breadth and height, and dug a basin
for a lake a great way above Babylon, close alongside of the stream,
which was sunk everywhere to the point where they came to water, and
was of such breadth that the whole circuit measured four hundred and
twenty furlongs. The soil dug out of this basin was made use of in the
embankments along the waterside. When the excavation was finished, she
had stones brought, and bordered with them the entire margin of the
reservoir. These two things were done, the river made to wind, and the
lake excavated, that the stream might be slacker by reason of the
number of curves, and the voyage be rendered circuitous, and that at
the end of the voyage it might be necessary to skirt the lake and so
make a long round. All these works were on that side of Babylon
where the passes lay, and the roads into Media were the straightest,
and the aim of the queen in making them was to prevent the Medes
from holding intercourse with the Babylonians, and so to keep them
in ignorance of her affairs.

While the soil from the excavation was being thus used for the
defence of the city, Nitocris engaged also in another undertaking, a
mere by-work compared with those we have already mentioned. The
city, as I said, was divided by the river into two distinct
portions. Under the former kings, if a man wanted to pass from one
of these divisions to the other, he had to cross in a boat; which
must, it seems to me, have been very troublesome. Accordingly, while
she was digging the lake, Nitocris be. thought herself of turning it
to a use which should at once remove this inconvenience, and enable
her to leave another monument of her reign over Babylon. She gave
orders for the hewing of immense blocks of stone, and when they were
ready and the basin was excavated, she turned the entire stream of the
Euphrates into the cutting, and thus for a time, while the basin was
filling, the natural channel of the river was left dry. Forthwith
she set to work, and in the first place lined the banks of the
stream within the city with quays of burnt brick, and also bricked the
landing-places opposite the river-gates, adopting throughout the
same fashion of brickwork which had been used in the town wall;
after which, with the materials which had been prepared, she built, as
near the middle of the town as possible, a stone bridge, the blocks
whereof were bound together with iron and lead. In the daytime
square wooden platforms were laid along from pier to pier, on which
the inhabitants crossed the stream; but at night they were
withdrawn, to prevent people passing from side to side in the dark
to commit robberies. When the river had filled the cutting, and the
bridge was finished, the Euphrates was turned back again into its
ancient bed; and thus the basin, transformed suddenly into a lake, was
seen to answer the purpose for which it was made, and the inhabitants,
by help of the basin, obtained the advantage of a bridge.

It was this same princess by whom a remarkable deception was
planned. She had her tomb constructed in the upper part of one of
the principal gateways of the city, high above the heads of the
passers by, with this inscription cut upon it:- "If there be one among
my successors on the throne of Babylon who is in want of treasure, let
him open my tomb, and take as much as he chooses- not, however, unless
he be truly in want, for it will not be for his good." This tomb
continued untouched until Darius came to the kingdom. To him it seemed
a monstrous thing that he should be unable to use one of the gates
of the town, and that a sum of money should be lying idle, and
moreover inviting his grasp, and he not seize upon it. Now he could
not use the gate, because, as he drove through, the dead body would
have been over his head. Accordingly he opened the tomb; but instead
of money, found only the dead body, and a writing which said- "Hadst
thou not been insatiate of pelf, and careless how thou gottest it,
thou wouldst not have broken open the sepulchres of the dead."

The expedition of Cyrus was undertaken against the son of this
princess, who bore the same name as his father Labynetus, and was king
of the Assyrians. The Great King, when he goes to the wars, is
always supplied with provisions carefully prepared at home, and with
cattle of his own. Water too from the river Choaspes, which flows by
Susa, is taken with him for his drink, as that is the only water which
the kings of Persia taste. Wherever he travels, he is attended by a
number of four-wheeled cars drawn by mules, in which the Choaspes
water, ready boiled for use, and stored in flagons of silver, is moved
with him from place to place.

Cyrus on his way to Babylon came to the banks of the Gyndes, a
stream which, rising in the Matienian mountains, runs through the
country of the Dardanians, and empties itself into the river Tigris.
The Tigris, after receiving the Gyndes, flows on by the city of
Opis, and discharges its waters into the Erythraean sea. When Cyrus
reached this stream, which could only be passed in boats, one of the
sacred white horses accompanying his march, full of spirit and high
mettle, walked into the water, and tried to cross by himself; but
the current seized him, swept him along with it, and drowned him in
its depths. Cyrus, enraged at the insolence of the river, threatened
so to break its strength that in future even women should cross it
easily without wetting their knees. Accordingly he put off for a
time his attack on Babylon, and, dividing his army into two parts,
he marked out by ropes one hundred and eighty trenches on each side of
the Gyndes, leading off from it in all directions, and setting his
army to dig, some on one side of the river, some on the other, he
accomplished his threat by the aid of so great a number of hands,
but not without losing thereby the whole summer season.

Having, however, thus wreaked his vengeance on the Gyndes, by
dispersing it through three hundred and sixty channels, Cyrus, with
the first approach of the ensuing spring, marched forward against
Babylon. The Babylonians, encamped without their walls, awaited his
coming. A battle was fought at a short distance from the city, in
which the Babylonians were defeated by the Persian king, whereupon
they withdrew within their defences. Here they shut themselves up, and
made light of his siege, having laid in a store of provisions for many
years in preparation against this attack; for when they saw Cyrus
conquering nation after nation, they were convinced that he would
never stop, and that their turn would come at last.

Cyrus was now reduced to great perplexity, as time went on and
he made no progress against the place. In this distress either some
one made the suggestion to him, or he bethought himself of a plan,
which he proceeded to put in execution. He placed a portion of his
army at the point where the river enters the city, and another body at
the back of the place where it issues forth, with orders to march into
the town by the bed of the stream, as soon as the water became shallow
enough: he then himself drew off with the unwarlike portion of his
host, and made for the place where Nitocris dug the basin for the
river, where he did exactly what she had done formerly: he turned
the Euphrates by a canal into the basin, which was then a marsh, on
which the river sank to such an extent that the natural bed of the
stream became fordable. Hereupon the Persians who had been left for
the purpose at Babylon by the, river-side, entered the stream, which
had now sunk so as to reach about midway up a man's thigh, and thus
got into the town. Had the Babylonians been apprised of what Cyrus was
about, or had they noticed their danger, they would never have allowed
the Persians to enter the city, but would have destroyed them utterly;
for they would have made fast all the street-gates which gave upon the
river, and mounting upon the walls along both sides of the stream,
would so have caught the enemy, as it were, in a trap. But, as it was,
the Persians came upon them by surprise and so took the city. Owing to
the vast size of the place, the inhabitants of the central parts (as
the residents at Babylon declare) long after the outer portions of the
town were taken, knew nothing of what had chanced, but as they were
engaged in a festival, continued dancing and revelling until they
learnt the capture but too certainly. Such, then, were the
circumstances of the first taking of Babylon.

Among many proofs which I shall bring forward of the power and
resources of the Babylonians, the following is of special account. The
whole country under the dominion of the Persians, besides paying a
fixed tribute, is parcelled out into divisions, which have to supply
food to the Great King and his army during different portions of the
year. Now out of the twelve months which go to a year, the district of
Babylon furnishes food during four, the other of Asia during eight; by
the which it appears that Assyria, in respect of resources, is
one-third of the whole of Asia. Of all the Persian governments, or
satrapies as they are called by the natives, this is by far the
best. When Tritantaechmes, son of Artabazus, held it of the king, it
brought him in an artaba of silver every day. The artaba is a
Persian measure, and holds three choenixes more than the medimnus of
the Athenians. He also had, belonging to his own private stud, besides
war horses, eight hundred stallions and sixteen thousand mares, twenty
to each stallion. Besides which he kept so great a number of Indian
hounds, that four large villages of the plain were exempted from all
other charges on condition of finding them in food.

But little rain falls in Assyria, enough, however, to make the
corn begin to sprout, after which the plant is nourished and the
ears formed by means of irrigation from the river. For the river
does not, as in Egypt, overflow the corn-lands of its own accord,
but is spread over them by the hand, or by the help of engines. The
whole of Babylonia is, like Egypt, intersected with canals. The
largest of them all, which runs towards the winter sun, and is
impassable except in boats, is carried from the Euphrates into another
stream, called the Tigris, the river upon which the town of Nineveh
formerly stood. Of all the countries that we know there is none
which is so fruitful in grain. It makes no pretension indeed of
growing the fig, the olive, the vine, or any other tree of the kind;
but in grain it is so fruitful as to yield commonly
two-hundred-fold, and when the production is the greatest, even
three-hundred-fold. The blade of the wheat-plant and barley-plant is
often four fingers in breadth. As for the millet and the sesame, I
shall not say to what height they grow, though within my own
knowledge; for I am not ignorant that what I have already written
concerning the fruitfulness of Babylonia must seem incredible to those
who have never visited the country. The only oil they use is made from
the sesame-plant. Palm-trees grow in great numbers over the whole of
the flat country, mostly of the kind which bears fruit, and this fruit
supplies them with bread, wine, and honey. They are cultivated like
the fig-tree in all respects, among others in this. The natives tie
the fruit of the male-palms, as they are called by the Greeks, to
the branches of the date-bearing palm, to let the gall-fly enter the
dates and ripen them, and to prevent the fruit from falling off. The
male-palms, like the wild fig-trees, have usually the gall-fly in
their fruit.

But that which surprises me most in the land, after the city
itself, I will now proceed to mention. The boats which come down the
river to Babylon are circular, and made of skins. The frames, which
are of willow, are cut in the country of the Armenians above
Assyria, and on these, which serve for hulls, a covering of skins is
stretched outside, and thus the boats are made, without either stem or
stern, quite round like a shield. They are then entirely filled with
straw, and their cargo is put on board, after which they are
suffered to float down the stream. Their chief freight is wine, stored
in casks made of the wood of the palm-tree. They are managed by two
men who stand upright in them, each plying an oar, one pulling and the
other pushing. The boats are of various sizes, some larger, some
smaller; the biggest reach as high as five thousand talents'
burthen. Each vessel has a live ass on board; those of larger size
have more than one. When they reach Babylon, the cargo is landed and
offered for sale; after which the men break up their boats, sell the
straw and the frames, and loading their asses with the skins, set
off on their way back to Armenia. The current is too strong to allow a
boat to return upstream, for which reason they make their boats of
skins rather than wood. On their return to Armenia they build fresh
boats for the next voyage.

The dress of the Babylonians is a linen tunic reaching to the
feet, and above it another tunic made in wool, besides which they have
a short white cloak thrown round them, and shoes of a peculiar
fashion, not unlike those worn by the Boeotians. They have long
hair, wear turbans on their heads, and anoint their whole body with
perfumes. Every one carries a seal, and a walking-stick, carved at the
top into the form of an apple, a rose, a lily, an eagle, or
something similar; for it is not their habit to use a stick without an
ornament.

Of their customs, whereof I shall now proceed to give an
account, the following (which I understand belongs to them in common
with the Illyrian tribe of the Eneti) is the wisest in my judgment.
Once a year in each village the maidens of age to marry were collected
all together into one place; while the men stood round them in a
circle. Then a herald called up the damsels one by one, and offered
them for sale. He began with the most beautiful. When she was sold for
no small sum of money, he offered for sale the one who came next to
her in beauty. All of them were sold to be wives. The richest of the
Babylonians who wished to wed bid against each other for the loveliest
maidens, while the humbler wife-seekers, who were indifferent about
beauty, took the more homely damsels with marriage-portions. For the
custom was that when the herald had gone through the whole number of
the beautiful damsels, he should then call up the ugliest- a
cripple, if there chanced to be one- and offer her to the men,
asking who would agree to take her with the smallest marriage-portion.
And the man who offered to take the smallest sum had her assigned to
him. The marriage-portions were furnished by the money paid for the
beautiful damsels, and thus the fairer maidens portioned out the
uglier. No one was allowed to give his daughter in marriage to the man
of his choice, nor might any one carry away the damsel whom he had
purchased without finding bail really and truly to make her his
wife; if, however, it turned out that they did not agree, the money
might be paid back. All who liked might come even from distant
villages and bid for the women. This was the best of all their
customs, but it has now fallen into disuse. They have lately hit
upon a very different plan to save their maidens from violence, and
prevent their being torn from them and carried to distant cities,
which is to bring up their daughters to be courtesans. This is now
done by all the poorer of the common people, who since the conquest
have been maltreated by their lords, and have had ruin brought upon
their families.

The following custom seems to me the wisest of their
institutions next to the one lately praised. They have no
physicians, but when a man is ill, they lay him in the public
square, and the passers-by come up to him, and if they have ever had
his disease themselves or have known any one who has suffered from it,
they give him advice, recommending him to do whatever they found
good in their own case, or in the case known to them; and no one is
allowed to pass the sick man in silence without asking him what his
ailment is.

They bury their dead in honey, and have funeral lamentations
like the Egyptians. When a Babylonian has consorted with his wife,
he sits down before a censer of burning incense, and the woman sits
opposite to him. At dawn of day they wash; for till they are washed
they will not touch any of their common vessels. This practice is
observed also by the Arabians.

The Babylonians have one most shameful custom. Every woman born in
the country must once in her life go and sit down in the precinct of
Venus, and there consort with a stranger. Many of the wealthier
sort, who are too proud to mix with the others, drive in covered
carriages to the precinct, followed by a goodly train of attendants,
and there take their station. But the larger number seat themselves
within the holy enclosure with wreaths of string about their heads-
and here there is always a great crowd, some coming and others
going; lines of cord mark out paths in all directions the women, and
the strangers pass along them to make their choice. A woman who has
once taken her seat is not allowed to return home till one of the
strangers throws a silver coin into her lap, and takes her with him
beyond the holy ground. When he throws the coin he says these words-
"The goddess Mylitta prosper thee." (Venus is called Mylitta by the
Assyrians.) The silver coin may be of any size; it cannot be
refused, for that is forbidden by the law, since once thrown it is
sacred. The woman goes with the first man who throws her money, and
rejects no one. When she has gone with him, and so satisfied the
goddess, she returns home, and from that time forth no gift however
great will prevail with her. Such of the women as are tall and
beautiful are soon released, but others who are ugly have to stay a
long time before they can fulfil the law. Some have waited three or
four years in the precinct. A custom very much like this is found also
in certain parts of the island of Cyprus.

Such are the customs of the Babylonians generally. There are
likewise three tribes among them who eat nothing but fish. These are
caught and dried in the sun, after which they are brayed in a
mortar, and strained through a linen sieve. Some prefer to make
cakes of this material, while others bake it into a kind of bread.

When Cyrus had achieved the conquest of the Babylonians, he
conceived the desire of bringing the Massagetae under his dominion.
Now the Massagetae are said to be a great and warlike nation, dwelling
eastward, toward the rising of the sun, beyond the river Araxes, and
opposite the Issedonians. By many they are regarded as a Scythian
race.

As for the Araxes, it is, according to some accounts, larger,
according to others smaller than the Ister (Danube). It has islands in
it, many of which are said to be equal in size to Lesbos. The men
who inhabit them feed during the summer on roots of all kinds, which
they dig out of the ground, while they store up the fruits, which they
gather from the trees at the fitting season, to serve them as food
in the winter-time. Besides the trees whose fruit they gather for this
purpose, they have also a tree which bears the strangest produce. When
they are met together in companies they throw some of it upon the fire
round which they are sitting, and presently, by the mere smell of
the fumes which it gives out in burning, they grow drunk, as the
Greeks do with wine. More of the fruit is then thrown on the fire,
and, their drunkenness increasing, they often jump up and begin to
dance and sing. Such is the account which I have heard of this people.

The river Araxes, like the Gyndes, which Cyrus dispersed into
three hundred and sixty channels, has its source in the country of the
Matienians. It has forty mouths, whereof all, except one, end in
bogs and swamps. These bogs and swamps are said to be inhabited by a
race of men who feed on raw fish, and clothe themselves with the skins
of seals. The other mouth of the river flows with a clear course
into the Caspian Sea.

The Caspian is a sea by itself, having no connection with any
other. The sea frequented by the Greeks, that beyond the Pillars of
Hercules, which is called the Atlantic, and also the Erythraean, are
all one and the same sea. But the Caspian is a distinct sea, lying
by itself, in length fifteen days' voyage with a row-boat, in breadth,
at the broadest part, eight days' voyage. Along its western shore runs
the chain of the Caucasus, the most extensive and loftiest of all
mountain-ranges. Many and various are the tribes by which it is
inhabited, most of whom live entirely on the wild fruits of the
forest. In these forests certain trees are said to grow, from the
leaves of which, pounded and mixed with water, the inhabitants make
a dye, wherewith they paint upon their clothes the figures of animals;
and the figures so impressed never wash out, but last as though they
had been inwoven in the cloth from the first, and wear as long as
the garment.

On the west then, as I have said, the Caspian Sea is bounded by
the range of Caucasus. On the cast it is followed by a vast plain,
stretching out interminably before the eye, the greater portion of
which is possessed by those Massagetae, against whom Cyrus was now
so anxious to make an expedition. Many strong motives weighed with him
and urged him on- his birth especially, which seemed something more
than human, and his good fortune in all his former wars, wherein he
had always found that against what country soever he turned his
arms, it was impossible for that people to escape.

At this time the Massagetae were ruled by a queen, named
Tomyris, who at the death of her husband, the late king, had mounted
the throne. To her Cyrus sent ambassadors, with instructions to
court her on his part, pretending that he wished to take her to
wife. Tomyris, however, aware that it was her kingdom, and not
herself, that he courted, forbade the men to approach. Cyrus,
therefore, finding that he did not advance his designs by this deceit,
marched towards the Araxes, and openly displaying his hostile
intentions; set to work to construct a bridge on which his army
might cross the river, and began building towers upon the boats
which were to be used in the passage.

While the Persian leader was occupied in these labours, Tomyris
sent a herald to him, who said, "King of the Medes, cease to press
this enterprise, for thou canst not know if what thou art doing will
be of real advantage to thee. Be content to rule in peace thy own
kingdom, and bear to see us reign over the countries that are ours
to govern. As, however, I know thou wilt not choose to hearken to this
counsel, since there is nothing thou less desirest than peace and
quietness, come now, if thou art so mightily desirous of meeting the
Massagetae in arms, leave thy useless toil of bridge-making; let us
retire three days' march from the river bank, and do thou come
across with thy soldiers; or, if thou likest better to give us
battle on thy side the stream, retire thyself an equal distance."
Cyrus, on this offer, called together the chiefs of the Persians,
and laid the matter before them, requesting them to advise him what he
should do. All the votes were in favour of his letting Tomyris cross
the stream, and giving battle on Persian ground.

But Croesus the Lydian, who was present at the meeting of the
chiefs, disapproved of this advice; he therefore rose, and thus
delivered his sentiments in opposition to it: "Oh! my king! I promised
thee long since, that, as Jove had given me into thy hands, I would,
to the best of my power, avert impending danger from thy house.
Alas! my own sufferings, by their very bitterness, have taught me to
be keen-sighted of dangers. If thou deemest thyself an immortal, and
thine army an army of immortals, my counsel will doubtless be thrown
away upon thee. But if thou feelest thyself to be a man, and a ruler
of men, lay this first to heart, that there is a wheel on which the
affairs of men revolve, and that its movement forbids the same man
to be always fortunate. Now concerning the matter in hand, my judgment
runs counter to the judgment of thy other counsellors. For if thou
agreest to give the enemy entrance into thy country, consider what
risk is run! Lose the battle, and therewith thy whole kingdom is lost.
For assuredly, the Massagetae, if they win the fight, will not
return to their homes, but will push forward against the states of thy
empire. Or if thou gainest the battle, why, then thou gainest far less
than if thou wert across the stream, where thou mightest follow up thy
victory. For against thy loss, if they defeat thee on thine own
ground, must be set theirs in like case. Rout their army on the
other side of the river, and thou mayest push at once into the heart
of their country. Moreover, were it not disgrace intolerable for Cyrus
the son of Cambyses to retire before and yield ground to a woman? My
counsel, therefore, is that we cross the stream, and pushing forward
as far as they shall fall back, then seek to get the better of them by
stratagem. I am told they are unacquainted with the good things on
which the Persians live, and have never tasted the great delights of
life. Let us then prepare a feast for them in our camp; let sheep be
slaughtered without stint, and the winecups be filled full of noble
liquor, and let all manner of dishes be prepared: then leaving
behind us our worst troops, let us fall back towards the river. Unless
I very much mistake, when they see the good fare set out, they will
forget all else and fall to. Then it will remain for us to do our
parts manfully."

Cyrus, when the two plans were thus placed in contrast before him,
changed his mind, and preferring the advice which Croesus had given,
returned for answer to Tomyris that she should retire, and that he
would cross the stream. She therefore retired, as she had engaged; and
Cyrus, giving Croesus into the care of his son Cambyses (whom he had
appointed to succeed him on the throne), with strict charge to pay him
all respect and treat him well, if the expedition failed of success;
and sending them both back to Persia, crossed the river with his army.

The first night after the passage, as he slept in the enemy's
country, a vision appeared to him. He seemed to see in his sleep the
eldest of the sons of Hystaspes, with wings upon his shoulders,
shadowing with the one wing Asia, and Europe with the other. Now
Hystaspes, the son of Arsames, was of the race of the Achaemenidae,
and his eldest son, Darius, was at that time scarce twenty years
old; wherefore, not being of age to go to the wars, he had remained
behind in Persia. When Cyrus woke from his sleep, and turned the
vision over in his mind, it seemed to him no light matter. He
therefore sent for Hystaspes, and taking him aside said, "Hystaspes,
thy son is discovered to be plotting against me and my crown. I will
tell thee how I know it so certainly. The gods watch over my safety,
and warn me beforehand of every danger. Now last night, as I lay in my
bed, I saw in a vision the eldest of thy sons with wings upon his
shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and Europe with the
other. From this it is certain, beyond all possible doubt, that he
is engaged in some plot against me. Return thou then at once to
Persia, and be sure, when I come back from conquering the
Massagetae, to have thy son ready to produce before me, that I may
examine him."

Thus Cyrus spoke, in the belief that he was plotted against by
Darius; but he missed the true meaning of the dream, which was sent by
God to forewarn him, that he was to die then and there, and that his
kingdom was to fall at last to Darius.

Hystaspes made answer to Cyrus in these words:- "Heaven forbid,
sire, that there should be a Persian living who would plot against
thee! If such an one there be, may a speedy death overtake him! Thou
foundest the Persians a race of slaves, thou hast made them free
men: thou foundest them subject to others, thou hast made them lords
of all. If a vision has announced that my son is practising against
thee, lo, I resign him into thy hands to deal with as thou wilt."
Hystaspes, when he had thus answered, recrossed the Araxes and
hastened back to Persia, to keep a watch on his son Darius.

Meanwhile Cyrus, having advanced a day's march from the river, did
as Croesus had advised him, and, leaving the worthless portion of
his army in the camp, drew off with his good troops towards the river.
Soon afterwards, a detachment of the Massagetae, one-third of their
entire army, led by Spargapises, son of the queen Tomyris, coming
up, fell upon the body which had been left behind by Cyrus, and on
their resistance put them to the sword. Then, seeing the banquet
prepared, they sat down and began to feast. When they had eaten and
drunk their fill, and were now sunk in sleep, the Persians under Cyrus
arrived, slaughtered a great multitude, and made even a larger
number prisoners. Among these last was Spargapises himself.

When Tomyris heard what had befallen her son and her army, she
sent a herald to Cyrus, who thus addressed the conqueror:- "Thou
bloodthirsty Cyrus, pride not thyself on this poor success: it was the
grape-juice- which, when ye drink it, makes you so mad, and as ye
swallow it down brings up to your lips such bold and wicked words-
it was this poison wherewith thou didst ensnare my child, and so
overcamest him, not in fair open fight. Now hearken what I advise, and
be sure I advise thee for thy good. Restore my son to me and get
thee from the land unharmed, triumphant over a third part of the
host of the Massagetae. Refuse, and I swear by the sun, the
sovereign lord of the Massagetae, bloodthirsty as thou art, I will
give thee thy fill of blood."

To the words of this message Cyrus paid no manner of regard. As
for Spargapises, the son of the queen, when the wine went off, 'and he
saw the extent of his calamity, he made request to Cyrus to release
him from his bonds; then, when his prayer was granted, and the fetters
were taken from his limbs, as soon as his hands were free, he
destroyed himself.

Tomyris, when she found that Cyrus paid no heed to her advice,
collected all the forces of her kingdom, and gave him battle. Of all
the combats in which the barbarians have engaged among themselves, I
reckon this to have been the fiercest. The following, as I understand,
was the manner of it:- First, the two armies stood apart and shot
their arrows at each other; then, when their quivers were empty,
they closed and fought hand-to-hand with lances and daggers; and
thus they continued fighting for a length of time, neither choosing to
give ground. At length the Massagetae prevailed. The greater part of
the army of the Persians was destroyed and Cyrus himself fell, after
reigning nine and twenty years. Search was made among the slain by
order of the queen for the body of Cyrus, and when it was found she
took a skin, and, filling it full of human blood, she dipped the
head of Cyrus in the gore, saying, as she thus insulted the corse,
"I live and have conquered thee in fight, and yet by thee am I ruined,
for thou tookest my son with guile; but thus I make good my threat,
and give thee thy fill of blood." Of the many different accounts which
are given of the death of Cyrus, this which I have followed appears to
me most worthy of credit.

In their dress and mode of living the Massagetae resemble the
Scythians. They fight both on horseback and on foot, neither method is
strange to them: they use bows and lances, but their favourite
weapon is the battle-axe. Their arms are all either of gold or
brass. For their spear-points, and arrow-heads, and for their
battle-axes, they make use of brass; for head-gear, belts, and
girdles, of gold. So too with the caparison of their horses, they give
them breastplates of brass, but employ gold about the reins, the
bit, and the cheek-plates. They use neither iron nor silver, having
none in their country; but they have brass and gold in abundance.

The following are some of their customs;- Each man has but one
wife, yet all the wives are held in common; for this is a custom of
the Massagetae and not of the Scythians, as the Greeks wrongly say.
Human life does not come to its natural close with this people; but
when a man grows very old, all his kinsfolk collect together and offer
him up in sacrifice; offering at the same time some cattle also. After
the sacrifice they boil the flesh and feast on it; and those who
thus end their days are reckoned the happiest. If a man dies of
disease they do not eat him, but bury him in the ground, bewailing his
ill-fortune that he did not come to be sacrificed. They sow no
grain, but live on their herds, and on fish, of which there is great
plenty in the Araxes. Milk is what they chiefly drink. The only god
they worship is the sun, and to him they offer the horse in sacrifice;
under the notion of giving to the swiftest of the gods the swiftest of
all mortal creatures.
