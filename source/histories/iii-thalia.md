The above-mentioned Amasis was the Egyptian king against whom
Cambyses, son of Cyrus, made his expedition; and with him went an army
composed of the many nations under his rule, among them being included
both Ionic and Aeolic Greeks. The reason of the invasion was the
following. Cambyses, by the advice of a certain Egyptian, who was
angry with Amasis for having torn him from his wife and children and
given him over to the Persians, had sent a herald to Amasis to ask his
daughter in marriage. His adviser was a physician, whom Amasis, when
Cyrus had requested that he would send him the most skilful of all the
Egyptian eye-doctors, singled out as the best from the whole number.
Therefore the Egyptian bore Amasis a grudge, and his reason for urging
Cambyses to ask the hand of the king's daughter was, that if he
complied, it might cause him annoyance; if he refused, it might make
Cambyses his enemy. When the message came, Amasis, who much dreaded
the power of the Persians, was greatly perplexed whether to give his
daughter or no; for that Cambyses did not intend to make her his wife,
but would only receive her as his concubine, he knew for certain. He
therefore cast the matter in his mind, and finally resolved what he
would do. There was a daughter of the late king Apries, named Nitetis,
a tall and beautiful woman, the last survivor of that royal house.
Amasis took this woman, and decking her out with gold and costly
garments, sent her to Persia as if she had been his own child. Some
time afterwards, Cambyses, as he gave her an embrace, happened to call
her by her father's name, whereupon she said to him, "I see, O king,
thou knowest not how thou has been cheated by Amasis; who took me,
and, tricking me out with gauds, sent me to thee as his own
daughter. But I am in truth the child of Apries, who was his lord
and master, until he rebelled against him, together with the rest of
the Egyptians, and put him to death." It was this speech, and the
cause of quarrel it disclosed, which roused the anger of Cambyses, son
of Cyrus, and brought his arms upon Egypt. Such is the Persian story.

The Egyptians, however, claim Cambyses as belonging to them,
declaring that he was the son of this Nitetis. It was Cyrus, they say,
and not Cambyses, who sent to Amasis for his daughter. But here they
mis-state the truth. Acquainted as they are beyond all other men
with the laws and customs of the Persians, they cannot but be well
aware, first, that it is not the Persian wont to allow a bastard to
reign when there is a legitimate heir; and next, that Cambyses was the
son of Cassandane, the daughter of Pharnaspes, an Achaemenian, and not
of this Egyptian. But the fact is that they pervert history in order
to claim relationship with the house of Cyrus. Such is the truth of
this matter.

I have also heard another account, which I do not at all
believe: that a Persian lady came to visit the wives of Cyrus, and
seeing how tall and beautiful were the children of Cassandane, then
standing by, broke out into loud praise of them, and admired them
exceedingly. But Cassandane, wife of Cyrus, answered, "Though such the
children I have borne him, yet Cyrus slights me and gives all his
regard to the new-comer from Egypt." Thus did she express her vexation
on account of Nitetis: whereupon Cambyses, the eldest of her boys,
exclaimed, "Mother, when I am a man, I will turn Egypt upside down for
you." He was but ten years old, as the tale runs, when he said this,
and astonished all the women, yet he never forgot it afterwards; and
on this account, they say, when he came to be a man, and mounted the
throne, he made his expedition against Egypt.

There was another matter, quite distinct, which helped to bring
about the expedition. One of the mercenaries of Amasis, a
Halicarnassian, Phanes by name, a man of good judgment, and a brave
warrior, dissatisfied for some reason or other with his master,
deserted the service, and taking ship, fled to Cambyses, wishing to
get speech with him. As he was a person of no small account among
the mercenaries, and one who could give very exact intelligence
about Egypt, Amasis, anxious to recover him, ordered that he should be
pursued. He gave the matter in charge to one of the most trusty of the
eunuchs, who went in quest of the Halicarnassian in a vessel of war.
The eunuch caught him in Lycia, but did not contrive to bring him back
to Egypt, for Phanes outwitted him by making his guards drunk, and
then escaping into Persia. Now it happened that Cambyses was
meditating his attack on Egypt, and doubting how he might best pass
the desert, when Phanes arrived, and not only told him all the secrets
of Amasis, but advised him also how the desert might be crossed. He
counselled him to send an ambassador to the king of the Arabs, and ask
him for safe-conduct through the region.

Now the only entrance into Egypt is by this desert: the country
from Phoenicia to the borders of the city Cadytis belongs to the
people called the Palaestine Syrians; from Cadytis, which it appears
to me is a city almost as large as Sardis, the marts upon the coast
till you reach Jenysus are the Arabian king's; after Jenysus the
Syrians again come in, and extend to Lake Serbonis, near the place
where Mount Casius juts out into the sea. At Lake Serbonis, where
the tale goes that Typhon hid himself, Egypt begins. Now the whole
tract between Jenysus on the one side, and Lake Serbonis and Mount
Casius on the other, and this is no small space, being as much as
three days' journey, is a dry desert without a drop of water.

I shall now mention a thing of which few of those who sail to
Egypt are aware. Twice a year wine is brought into Egypt from every
part of Greece, as well as from Phoenicia, in earthen jars; and yet in
the whole country you will nowhere see, as I may say, a single jar.
What then, every one will ask, becomes of the jars? This, too, I
will clear up. The burgomaster of each town has to collect the
wine-jars within his district, and to carry them to Memphis, where
they are all filled with water by the Memphians, who then convey
them to this desert tract of Syria. And so it comes to pass that all
the jars which enter Egypt year by year, and are there put up to sale,
find their way into Syria, whither all the old jars have gone before
them.

This way of keeping the passage into Egypt fit for use by
storing water there, was begun by the Persians so soon as they
became masters of that country. As, however, at the time of which we
speak the tract had not yet been so supplied, Cambyses took the advice
of his Halicarnassian guest, and sent messengers to the Arabian to beg
a safe-conduct through the region. The Arabian granted his prayer, and
each pledged faith to the other.

The Arabs keep such pledges more religiously than almost any other
people. They plight faith with the forms following. When two men would
swear a friendship, they stand on each side of a third: he with a
sharp stone makes a cut on the inside of the hand of each near the
middle finger, and, taking a piece from their dress, dips it in the
blood of each, and moistens therewith seven stones lying in the midst,
calling the while on Bacchus and Urania. After this, the man who makes
the pledge commends the stranger (or the citizen, if citizen he be) to
all his friends, and they deem themselves bound to stand to the
engagement. They have but these two gods, to wit, Bacchus and
Urania; and they say that in their mode of cutting the hair, they
follow Bacchus. Now their practice is to cut it in a ring, away from
the temples. Bacchus they call in their language Orotal, and Urania,
Alilat.

When therefore the Arabian had pledged his faith to the messengers
of Cambyses, he straightway contrived as follows:- he filled a
number of camels' skins with water, and loading therewith all the live
camels that he possessed, drove them into the desert, and awaited
the coming of the army. This is the more likely of the two tales
that are told. The other is an improbable story, but, as it is
related, I think that I ought not to pass it by. There is a great
river in Arabia, called the Corys, which empties itself into the
Erythraean sea. The Arabian king, they say, made a pipe of the skins
of oxen and other beasts, reaching from this river all the way to
the desert, and so brought the water to certain cisterns which he
had dug in the desert to receive it. It is a twelve days' journey from
the river to this desert tract. And the water, they say, was brought
through three different pipes to three separate places.

Psammenitus, son of Amasis, lay encamped at the mouth of the.
Nile, called the Pelusiac, awaiting Cambyses. For Cambyses, when he
went up against Egypt, found Amasis no longer in life: he had died
after ruling Egypt forty and four years, during all which time no
great misfortune had befallen him. When he died, his body was
embalmed, and buried in the tomb which he had himself caused to be
made in the temple. After his son Psammenitus had mounted the
throne, a strange prodigy occurred in Egypt- rain fell at Egyptian
Thebes, a thing which never happened before, and which, to the present
time, has never happened again, as the Thebans themselves testify.
In Upper Egypt it does not usually rain at all; but on this
occasion, rain fell at Thebes in small drops.

The Persians crossed the desert, and, pitching their camp close to
the Egyptians, made ready for battle. Hereupon the mercenaries in
the pay of Psammenitus, who were Greeks and Carians, full of anger
against Phanes for having brought a foreign army upon Egypt, bethought
themselves of a mode whereby they might be revenged on him. Phanes had
left sons in Egypt. The mercenaries took these, and leading them to
the camp, displayed them before the eyes of their father; after
which they brought out a bowl, and, placing it in the space between
the two hosts, they led the sons of Phanes, one by one, to the vessel,
and slew them over it. When the last was dead, water and wine were
poured into the bowl, and all the soldiers tasted of the blood, and so
they went to the battle. Stubborn was the fight which followed, and it
was not till vast numbers had been slain upon both sides, that the
Egyptians turned and fled.

On the field where this battle was fought I saw a very wonderful
thing which the natives pointed out to me. The bones of the slain
lie scattered upon the field in two lots, those of the Persians in one
place by themselves, as the bodies lay at the first- those of the
Egyptians in another place apart from them. If, then, you strike the
Persian skulls, even with a pebble, they are so weak, that you break a
hole in them; but the Egyptian skulls are so strong, that you may
smite them with a stone and you will scarcely break them in. They gave
me the following reason for this difference, which seemed to me likely
enough:- The Egyptians (they said) from early childhood have the
head shaved, and so by the action of the sun the skull becomes thick
and hard. The same cause prevents baldness in Egypt, where you see
fewer bald men than in any other land. Such, then, is the reason why
the skulls of the Egyptians are so strong. The Persians, on the
other hand, have feeble skulls, because they keep themselves shaded
from the first, wearing turbans upon their heads. What I have here
mentioned I saw with my own eyes, and I observed also the like at
Papremis, in the case of the Persians who were killed with
Achaeamenes, the son of Darius, by Inarus the Libyan.

The Egyptians who fought in the battle, no sooner turned their
backs upon the enemy, than they fled away in complete disorder to
Memphis, where they shut themselves up within the walls. Hereupon
Cambyses sent a Mytilenaean vessel, with a Persian herald on board,
who was to sail up the Nile to Memphis, and invite the Egyptians to
a surrender. They, however, when they saw the vessel entering the
town, poured forth in crowds from the castle, destroyed the ship, and,
tearing the crew limb from limb, so bore them into the fortress. After
this Memphis was besieged, and in due time surrendered. Hereon the
Libyans who bordered upon Egypt, fearing the fate of that country,
gave themselves up to Cambyses without a battle, made an agreement
to pay tribute to him, and forthwith sent him gifts. The Cyrenaeans
too, and the Barcaeans, having the same fear as the Libyans,
immediately did the like. Cambyses received the Libyan presents very
graciously, but not so the gifts of the Cyrenaeans. They had sent no
more than five hundred minx of silver, which Cambyses, I imagine,
thought too little. He therefore snatched the money from them, and
with his own hands scattered it among his soldiers.

Ten days after the fort had fallen, Cambyses resolved to try the
spirit of Psammenitus, the Egyptian king, whose whole reign had been
but six months. He therefore had him set in one of the suburbs, and
many other Egyptians with him, and there subjected him to insult.
First of all he sent his daughter out from the city, clothed in the
garb of a slave, with a pitcher to draw water. Many virgins, the
daughters of the chief nobles, accompanied her, wearing the same
dress. When the damsels came opposite the place where their fathers
sate, shedding tears and uttering cries of woe, the fathers, all but
Psammenitus, wept and wailed in return, grieving to see their children
in so sad a plight; but he, when he had looked and seen, bent his head
towards the ground. In this way passed by the water-carriers. Next
to them came Psammenitus' son, and two thousand Egyptians of the
same age with him- all of them having ropes round their necks and
bridles in their mouths- and they too passed by on their way to suffer
death for the murder of the Mytilenaeans who were destroyed, with
their vessel, in Memphis. For so had the royal judges given their
sentence for each Mytilenaean ten of the noblest Egyptians must
forfeit life." King Psammenitus saw the train pass on, and knew his
son was being led to death, but while the other Egyptians who sate
around him wept and were sorely troubled, he showed no further sign
than when he saw his daughter. And now, when they too were gone, it
chanced that one of his former boon-companions, a man advanced in
years, who had been stripped of all that he had and was a beggar, came
where Psammenitus, son of Amasis, and the rest of the Egyptians
were, asking alms from the soldiers. At this sight the king burst into
tears, and weeping out aloud, called his friend by his name, and smote
himself on the head. Now there were some who had been set to watch
Psammenitus and see what he would do as each train went by; so these
persons went and told Cambyses of his behaviour. Then he, astonished
at what was done, sent a messenger to Psammenitus, and questioned him,
saying, "Psammenitus, thy lord Cambyses asketh thee why, when thou
sawest thy daughter brought to shame, and thy son on his way to death,
thou didst neither utter cry nor shed tear, while to a beggar, who is,
he hears, a stranger to thy race, thou gavest those marks of
honour." To this question Psammenitus made answer, "O son of Cyrus, my
own misfortunes were too great for tears; but the woe of my friend
deserved them. When a man falls from splendour and plenty into beggary
at the threshold of old age, one may well weep for him." When the
messenger brought back this answer, Cambyses owned it was just;
Croesus, likewise, the Egyptians say, burst into tears- for he too had
come into Egypt with Cambyses- and the Persians who were present wept.
Even Cambyses himself was touched with pity, and he forthwith gave
an order that the son of Psammenitus should be spared from the
number of those appointed to die, and Psammenitus himself brought from
the suburb into his presence.

The messengers were too late to save the life of Psammenitus' son,
who had been cut in pieces the first of all; but they took Psammenitus
himself and brought him before the king. Cambyses allowed him to
live with him, and gave him no more harsh treatment; nay, could he
have kept from intermeddling with affairs, he might have recovered
Egypt, and ruled it as governor. For the Persian wont is to treat
the sons of kings with honour, and even to give their fathers'
kingdoms to the children of such as revolt from them. There are many
cases from which one may collect that this is the Persian rule, and
especially those of Pausiris and Thannyras. Thannyras was son of
Inarus the Libyan, and was allowed to succeed his father, as was
also Pausiris, son of Amyrtaeus; yet certainly no two persons ever did
the Persians more damage than Amyrtaeus and Inarus. In this case
Psammenitus plotted evil, and received his reward accordingly. He
was discovered to be stirring up revolt in Egypt, wherefore
Cambyses, when his guilt clearly appeared, compelled him to drink
bull's blood, which presently caused his death. Such was the end of
Psammenitus.

After this Cambyses left Memphis, and went to Sais, wishing to
do that which he actually did on his arrival there. He entered the
palace of Amasis, and straightway commanded that the body of the
king should be brought forth from the sepulchre. When the attendants
did according to his commandment, he further bade them scourge the
body, and prick it with goads, and pluck the hair from it, and heap
upon it all manner of insults. The body, however, having been
embalmed, resisted, and refused to come apart, do what they would to
it; so the attendants grew weary of their work; whereupon Cambyses
bade them take the corpse and burn it. This was truly an impious
command to give, for the Persians hold fire to be a god, and never
by any chance burn their dead. Indeed this practice is unlawful,
both with them and with the Egyptians- with them for the reason
above mentioned, since they deem it wrong to give the corpse of a
man to a god; and with the Egyptians, because they believe fire to
be a live animal, which eats whatever it can seize, and then,
glutted with the food, dies with the matter which it feeds upon. Now
to give a man's body to be devoured by beasts is in no wise
agreeable to their customs, and indeed this is the very reason why
they embalm their dead; namely, to prevent them from being eaten in
the grave by worms. Thus Cambyses commanded what both nations
accounted unlawful. According to the Egyptians, it was not Amasis
who was thus treated, but another of their nation who was of about the
same height. The Persians, believing this man's body to be the king's,
abused it in the fashion described above. Amasis, they say, was warned
by an oracle of what would happen to him after his death: in order,
therefore, to prevent the impending fate, he buried the body, which
afterwards received the blows, inside his own tomb near the
entrance, commanding his son to bury him, when he died, in the
furthest recess of the same sepulchre. For my own part I do not
believe that these orders were ever given by Amasis; the Egyptians, as
it seems to me, falsely assert it, to save their own dignity.

After this Cambyses took counsel with himself, and planned three
expeditions. One was against the Carthaginians, another against the
Ammonians, and a third against the long-lived Ethiopians, who dwelt in
that part of Libya which borders upon the southern sea. He judged it
best to despatch his fleet against Carthage and to send some portion
of his land army to act against the Ammonians, while his spies went
into Ethiopia, under the pretence of carrying presents to the king,
but in reality to take note of all they saw, and especially to observe
whether there was really what is called "the table of the Sun" in
Ethiopia.

Now the table of the Sun according to the accounts given of it may
be thus described:- It is a meadow in the skirts of their city full of
the boiled flesh of all manner of beasts, which the magistrates are
careful to store with meat every night, and where whoever likes may
come and eat during the day. The people of the land say that the earth
itself brings forth the food. Such is the description which is given
of this table.

When Cambyses had made up his mind that the spies should go, he
forthwith sent to Elephantine for certain of the Icthyophagi who
were acquainted with the Ethiopian tongue; and, while they were
being fetched, issued orders to his fleet to sail against Carthage.
But the Phoenicians said they would not go, since they were bound to
the Carthaginians by solemn oaths, and since besides it would be
wicked in them to make war on their own children. Now when the
Phoenicians refused, the rest of the fleet was unequal to the
undertaking; and so it was that the Carthaginians escaped, and were
not enslaved by the Persians. Cambyses thought it not right to force
the war upon the Phoenicians, because they had yielded themselves to
the Persians, and because upon the Phoenicians all his sea-service
depended. The Cyprians had also joined the Persians of their own
accord, and took part with them in the expedition against Egypt.

As soon as the Icthyophagi arrived from Elephantine, Cambyses,
having told them what they were to say, forthwith despatched them into
Ethiopia with these following gifts: to wit, a purple robe, a gold
chain for the neck, armlets, an alabaster box of myrrh, and a cask
of palm wine. The Ethiopians to whom this embassy was sent are said to
be the tallest and handsomest men in the whole world. In their customs
they differ greatly from the rest of mankind, and particularly in
the way they choose their kings; for they find out the man who is
the tallest of all the citizens, and of strength equal to his
height, and appoint him to rule over them.

The Icthyophagi on reaching this people, delivered the gifts to
the king of the country, and spoke as follows:- "Cambyses, king of the
Persians, anxious to become thy ally and sworn friend, has sent us
to hold converse with thee, and to bear thee the gifts thou seest,
which are the things wherein he himself delights the most." Hereon the
Ethiopian, who knew they came as spies, made answer:- "The king of the
Persians sent you not with these gifts because he much desired to
become my sworn friend- nor is the account which ye give of yourselves
true, for ye are come to search out my kingdom. Also your king is
not a just man- for were he so, he had not coveted a land which is not
his own, nor brought slavery on a people who never did him any
wrong. Bear him this bow, and say- 'The king of the Ethiops thus
advises the king of the Persians when the Persians can pull a bow of
this strength thus easily, then let him come with an army of
superior strength against the long-lived Ethiopians- till then, let
him thank the gods that they have not put it into the heart of the
sons of the Ethiops to covet countries which do not belong to them.'

So speaking, he unstrung the bow, and gave it into the hands of
the messengers. Then, taking the purple robe, he asked them what it
was, and how it had been made. They answered truly, telling him
concerning the purple, and the art of the dyer- whereat he observed
"that the men were deceitful, and their garments also." Next he took
the neck-chain and the armlets, and asked about them. So the
Icthyophagi explained their use as ornaments. Then the king laughed,
and fancying they were fetters, said, "the Ethiopians had much
stronger ones." Thirdly, he inquired about the myrrh, and when they
told him how it was made and rubbed upon the limbs, he said the same
as he had said about the robe. Last of all he came to the wine, and
having learnt their way of making it, he drank a draught, which
greatly delighted him; whereupon he asked what the Persian king was
wont to eat, and to what age the longest-lived of the Persians had
been known to attain. They told him that the king ate bread, and
described the nature of wheat- adding that eighty years was the
longest term of man's life among the Persians. Hereat he remarked, "It
did not surprise him, if they fed on dirt, that they died so soon;
indeed he was sure they never would have lived so long as eighty
years, except for the refreshment they got from that drink (meaning
the wine), wherein he confessed the Persians surpassed the
Ethiopians."

The Icthyophagi then in their turn questioned the king
concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told
that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while
some even went beyond that age- they ate boiled flesh, and had for
their drink nothing but milk. When the Icthyophagi showed wonder at
the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when
they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if
they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that
of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float
in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the
bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their
constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived. When
they quitted the fountain the king led them to a prison, where the
prisoners were all of them bound with fetters of gold. Among these
Ethiopians copper is of all metals the most scarce and valuable. After
they had seen the prison, they were likewise shown what is called "the
table of the Sun."

Also, last of all, they were allowed to behold the coffins of
the Ethiopians, which are made (according to report) of crystal, after
the following fashion:- When the dead body has been dried, either in
the Egyptian, or in some other manner, they cover the whole with
gypsum, and adorn it with painting until it is as like the living
man as possible. Then they place the body in a crystal pillar which
has been hollowed out to receive it, crystal being dug up in great
abundance in their country, and of a kind very easy to work. You may
see the corpse through the pillar within which it lies; and it neither
gives out any unpleasant odour, nor is it in any respect unseemly; yet
there is no part that is not as plainly visible as if the body were
bare. The next of kin keep the crystal pillar in their houses for a
full year from the time of the death, and give it the first fruits
continually, and honour it with sacrifice. After the year is out
they bear the pillar forth, and set it up near the town.

When the spies had now seen everything, they returned back to
Egypt, and made report to Cambyses, who was stirred to anger by
their words. Forthwith he set out on his march against the
Ethiopians without having made any provision for the sustenance of his
army, or reflected that he was about to wage war in the uttermost
parts of the earth. Like a senseless madman as he was, no sooner did
he receive the report of the Icthyophagi than he began his march,
bidding the Greeks who were with his army remain where they were,
and taking only his land force with him. At Thebes, which he passed
through on his way, he detached from his main body some fifty thousand
men, and sent them against the Ammonians with orders to carry the
people into captivity, and burn the oracle of Jupiter. Meanwhile he
himself went on with the rest of his forces against the Ethiopians.
Before, however, he had accomplished one-fifth part of the distance,
all that the army had in the way of provisions failed; whereupon the
men began to eat the sumpter beasts, which shortly failed also. If
then, at this time, Cambyses, seeing what was happening, had confessed
himself in the wrong, and led his army back, he would have done the
wisest thing that he could after the mistake made at the outset; but
as it was, he took no manner of heed, but continued to march forwards.
So long as the earth gave them anything, the soldiers sustained life
by eating the grass and herbs; but when they came to the bare sand,
a portion of them were guilty of a horrid deed: by tens they cast lots
for a man, who was slain to be the food of the others. When Cambyses
heard of these doings, alarmed at such cannibalism, he gave up his
attack on Ethiopia, and retreating by the way he had come, reached
Thebes, after he had lost vast numbers of his soldiers. From Thebes he
marched down to Memphis, where he dismissed the Greeks, allowing
them to sail home. And so ended the expedition against Ethiopia.

The men sent to attack the Ammonians, started from Thebes,
having guides with them, and may be clearly traced as far as the
city Oasis, which is inhabited by Samians, said to be of the tribe
Aeschrionia. The place is distant from Thebes seven days' journey
across the sand, and is called in our tongue "the Island of the
Blessed." Thus far the army is known to have made its way; but
thenceforth nothing is to be heard of them, except what the Ammonians,
and those who get their knowledge from them, report. It is certain
they neither reached the Ammonians, nor even came back to Egypt.
Further than this, the Ammonians relate as follows:- That the Persians
set forth from Oasis across the sand, and had reached about half way
between that place and themselves when, as they were at their midday
meal, a wind arose from the south, strong and deadly, bringing with it
vast columns of whirling sand, which entirely covered up the troops
and caused them wholly to disappear. Thus, according to the Ammonians,
did it fare with this army.

About the time when Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis appeared
to the Egyptians. Now Apis is the god whom the Greeks call Epaphus. As
soon as he appeared, straightway all the Egyptians arrayed
themselves in their gayest garments, and fell to feasting and jollity:
which when Cambyses saw, making sure that these rejoicings were on
account of his own ill success, he called before him the officers
who had charge of Memphis, and demanded of them- "Why, when he was
in Memphis before, the Egyptians had done nothing of this kind, but
waited until now, when he had returned with the loss of so many of his
troops?" The officers made answer, "That one of their gods had
appeared to them, a god who at long intervals of time had been
accustomed to show himself in Egypt- and that always on his appearance
the whole of Egypt feasted and kept jubilee." When Cambyses heard
this, he told them that they lied, and as liars he condemned them
all to suffer death.

When they were dead, he called the priests to his presence, and
questioning them received the same answer; whereupon he observed,
"That he would soon know whether a tame god had really come to dwell
in Egypt"- and straightway, without another word, he bade them bring
Apis to him. So they went out from his presence to fetch the god.
Now this Apis, or Epaphus, is the calf of a cow which is never
afterwards able to bear young. The Egyptians say that fire comes
down from heaven upon the cow, which thereupon conceives Apis. The
calf which is so called has the following marks:- He is black, with
a square spot of white upon his forehead, and on his back the figure
of an eagle; the hairs in his tail are double, and there is a beetle
upon his tongue.

When the priests returned bringing Apis with them, Cambyses,
like the harebrained person that he was, drew his dagger, and aimed at
the belly of the animal, but missed his mark, and stabbed him in the
thigh. Then he laughed, and said thus to the priests:- "Oh!
blockheads, and think ye that gods become like this, of flesh and
blood, and sensible to steel? A fit god indeed for Egyptians, such
an one! But it shall cost you dear that you have made me your
laughing-stock." When he had so spoken, he ordered those whose
business it was to scourge the priests, and if they found any of the
Egyptians keeping festival to put them to death. Thus was the feast
stopped throughout the land of Egypt, and the priests suffered
punishment. Apis, wounded in the thigh, lay some time pining in the
temple; at last he died of his wound, and the priests buried him
secretly without the knowledge of Cambyses.

And now Cambyses, who even before had not been quite in his
right mind, was forthwith, as the Egyptians say, smitten with
madness for this crime. The first of his outrages was the slaying of
Smerdis, his full brother, whom he had sent back to Persia from
Egypt out of envy, because he drew the bow brought from the Ethiopians
by the Icthyophagi (which none of the other Persians were able to
bend) the distance of two fingers' breadth. When Smerdis was
departed into Persia, Cambyses had a vision in his sleep- he thought a
messenger from Persia came to him with tidings that Smerdis sat upon
the royal throne and with his head touched the heavens. Fearing
therefore for himself, and thinking it likely that his brother would
kill him and rule in his stead, Cambyses sent into Persia Prexaspes,
whom he trusted beyond all the other Persians, bidding him put Smerdis
to death. So this Prexaspes went up to Susa and slew Smerdis. Some say
he killed him as they hunted together, others, that he took him down
to the Erythraean Sea, and there drowned him.

This, it is said, was the first outrage which Cambyses
committed. The second was the slaying of his sister, who had
accompanied him into Egypt, and lived with him as his wife, though she
was his full sister, the daughter both of his father and his mother.
The way wherein he had made her his wife was the following:-It was not
the custom of the Persians, before his time, to marry their sisters,
but Cambyses, happening to fall in love with one of his and wishing to
take her to wife, as he knew that it was an uncommon thing, called
together the royal judges, and put it to them, "whether there was
any law which allowed a brother, if he wished, to marry his sister?"
Now the royal judges are certain picked men among the Persians, who
hold their office for life, or until they are found guilty of some
misconduct. By them justice is administered in Persia, and they are
the interpreters of the old laws, all disputes being referred to their
decision. When Cambyses, therefore, put his question to these
judges, they gave him an answer which was at once true and safe- "they
did not find any law," they said, "allowing a brother to take his
sister to wife, but they found a law, that the king of the Persians
might do whatever he pleased." And so they neither warped the law
through fear of Cambyses, nor ruined themselves by over stiffly
maintaining the law; but they brought another quite distinct law to
the king's help, which allowed him to have his wish. Cambyses,
therefore, married the object of his love, and no long time afterwards
he took to wife another sister. It was the younger of these who went
with him into Egypt, and there suffered death at his hands.

Concerning the manner of her death, as concerning that of Smerdis,
two different accounts are given. The story which the Greeks tell is
that Cambyses had set a young dog to fight the cub of a lioness- his
wife looking on at the time. Now the dog was getting the worse, when a
pup of the same litter broke his chain, and came to his brother's aid-
then the two dogs together fought the lion, and conquered him. The
thing greatly pleased Cambyses, but his sister who was sitting by shed
tears. When Cambyses saw this, he asked her why she wept: whereon
she told him, that seeing the young dog come to his brother's aid made
her think of Smerdis, whom there was none to help. For this speech,
the Greeks say, Cambyses put her to death. But the Egyptians tell
the story thus:- The two were sitting at table, when the sister took a
lettuce, and stripping the leaves off, asked her brother "when he
thought the lettuce looked the prettiest- when it had all its leaves
on, or now that it was stripped?" He answered, "When the leaves were
on." "But thou," she rejoined, "hast done as I did to the lettuce, and
made bare the house of Cyrus." Then Cambyses was wroth, and sprang
fiercely upon her, though she was with child at the time. And so it
came to pass that she miscarried and died.

Thus mad was Cambyses upon his own kindred, and this either from
his usage of Apis, or from some other among the many causes from which
calamities are wont to arise. They say that from his birth he was
afflicted with a dreadful disease, the disorder which some call "the
sacred sickness." It would be by no means strange, therefore, if his
mind were affected in some degree, seeing that his body laboured under
so sore a malady.

He was mad also upon others besides his kindred; among the rest,
upon Prexaspes, the man whom he esteemed beyond all the rest of the
Persians, who carried his messages, and whose son held the office-
an honour of no small account in Persia- of his cupbearer. Him
Cambyses is said to have once addressed as follows:- "What sort of
man, Prexaspes, do the Persians think me? What do they say of me?"
Prexaspes answered, "Oh! sire, they praise thee greatly in all
things but one- they say thou art too much given to love of wine."
Such Prexaspes told him was the judgment of the Persians; whereupon
Cambyses, full of rage, made answer, "What? they say now that I
drink too much wine, and so have lost my senses, and am gone out of my
mind! Then their former speeches about me were untrue." For once, when
the Persians were sitting with him, and Croesus was by, he had asked
them, "What sort of man they thought him compared to his father
Cyrus?" Hereon they had answered, "That he surpassed his father, for
he was lord of all that his father ever ruled, and further had made
himself master of Egypt, and the sea." Then Croesus, who was
standing near, and misliked the comparison, spoke thus to Cambyses:
"In my judgment, O son of Cyrus, thou art not equal to thy father, for
thou hast not yet left behind thee such a son as he." Cambyses was
delighted when he heard this reply, and praised the judgment of
Croesus.

Recollecting these answers, Cambyses spoke fiercely to
Prexaspes, saying, "Judge now thyself, Prexaspes, whether the Persians
tell the truth, or whether it is not they who are mad for speaking
as they do. Look there now at thy son standing in the vestibule- if
I shoot and hit him right in the middle of the heart, it will be plain
the Persians have no grounds for what they say: if I miss him, then
I allow that the Persians are right, and that I am out of my mind." So
speaking he drew his bow to the full, and struck the boy, who
straightway fell down dead. Then Cambyses ordered the body to be
opened, and the wound examined; and when the arrow was found to have
entered the heart, the king was quite overjoyed, and said to the
father with a laugh, "Now thou seest plainly, Prexaspes, that it is
not I who am mad, but the Persians who have lost their senses. I
pray thee tell me, sawest thou ever mortal man send an arrow with a
better aim?" Prexaspes, seeing that the king was not in his right
mind, and fearing for himself, replied, "Oh! my lord, I do not think
that God himself could shoot so dexterously." Such was the outrage
which Cambyses committed at this time: at another, he took twelve of
the noblest Persians, and, without bringing any charge worthy of death
against them, buried them all up to the neck.

Hereupon Croesus the Lydian thought it right to admonish Cambyses,
which he did in these words following:- "Oh! king, allow not thyself
to give way entirely to thy youth, and the heat of thy temper, but
check and control thyself. It is well to look to consequences, and
in forethought is true wisdom. Thou layest hold of men, who are thy
fellow-citizens, and, without cause of complaint, slayest them- thou
even puttest children to death- bethink thee now, if thou shalt
often do things like these, will not the Persians rise in revolt
against thee? It is by thy father's wish that I offer thee advice;
he charged me strictly to give thee such counsel as I might see to
be most for thy good." In thus advising Cambyses, Croesus meant
nothing but what was friendly. But Cambyses answered him, "Dost thou
presume to offer me advice? Right well thou ruledst thy own country
when thou wert a king, and right sage advice thou gavest my father
Cyrus, bidding him cross the Araxes and fight the Massagetae in
their own land, when they were willing to have passed over into
ours. By thy misdirection of thine own affairs thou broughtest ruin
upon thyself, and by thy bad counsel, which he followed, thou
broughtest ruin upon Cyrus, my father. But thou shalt not escape
punishment now, for I have long been seeking to find some occasion
against thee." As he thus spoke, Cambyses took up his bow to shoot
at Croesus; but Croesus ran hastily out, and escaped. So when Cambyses
found that he could not kill him with his bow, he bade his servants
seize him, and put him to death. The servants, however, who knew their
master's humour, thought it best to hide Croesus; that so, if Cambyses
relented, and asked for him, they might bring him out, and get a
reward for having saved his life- if, on the other hand, he did not
relent, or regret the loss, they might then despatch him. Not long
afterwards, Cambyses did in fact regret the loss of Croesus, and the
servants, perceiving it, let him know that he was still alive. "I am
glad," said he, "that Croesus lives, but as for you who saved him,
ye shall not escape my vengeance, but shall all of you be put to
death." And he did even as he had said.

Many other wild outrages of this sort did Cambyses commit, both
upon the Persians and the allies, while he still stayed at Memphis;
among the rest he opened the ancient sepulchres, and examined the
bodies that were buried in them. He likewise went into the temple of
Vulcan, and made great sport of the image. For the image of Vulcan
is very like the Pataeci of the Phoenicians, wherewith they ornament
the prows of their ships of war. If persons have not seen these, I
will explain in a different way- it is a figure resembling that of a
pigmy. He went also into the temple of the Cabiri, which it is
unlawful for any one to enter except the priests, and not only made
sport of the images, but even burnt them. They are made like the
statue of Vulcan, who is said to have been their father.

Thus it appears certain to me, by a great variety of proofs,
that Cambyses was raving mad; he would not else have set himself to
make a mock of holy rites and long-established usages. For if one were
to offer men to choose out of all the customs in the world such as
seemed to them the best, they would examine the whole number, and
end by preferring their own; so convinced are they that their own
usages far surpass those of all others. Unless, therefore, a man was
mad, it is not likely that he would make sport of such matters. That
people have this feeling about their laws may be seen by very many
proofs: among others, by the following. Darius, after he had got the
kingdom, called into his presence certain Greeks who were at hand, and
asked- "What he should pay them to eat the bodies of their fathers
when they died?" To which they answered, that there was no sum that
would tempt them to do such a thing. He then sent for certain Indians,
of the race called Callatians, men who eat their fathers, and asked
them, while the Greeks stood by, and knew by the help of an
interpreter all that was said - "What he should give them to burn
the bodies of their fathers at their decease?" The Indians exclaimed
aloud, and bade him forbear such language. Such is men's wont
herein; and Pindar was right, in my judgment, when he said, "Law is
the king o'er all."

While Cambyses was carrying on this war in Egypt, the
Lacedaemonians likewise sent a force to Samos against Polycrates,
the son of Aeaces, who had by insurrection made himself master of that
island. At the outset he divided the state into three parts, and
shared the kingdom with his brothers, Pantagnotus and Syloson; but
later, having killed the former and banished the latter, who was the
younger of the two, he held the whole island. Hereupon he made a
contract of friendship with Amasis the Egyptian king, sending him
gifts, and receiving from him others in return. In a little while
his power so greatly increased, that the fame of it went abroad
throughout Ionia and the rest of Greece. Wherever he turned his
arms, success waited on him. He had a fleet of a hundred penteconters,
and bowmen to the number of a thousand. Herewith he plundered all,
without distinction of friend or foe; for he argued that a friend
was better pleased if you gave him back what you had taken from him,
than if you spared him at the first. He captured many of the
islands, and several towns upon the mainland. Among his other doings
he overcame the Lesbians in a sea-fight, when they came with all their
forces to the help of Miletus, and made a number of them prisoners.
These persons, laden with fetters, dug the moat which surrounds the
castle at Samos.

The exceeding good fortune of Polycrates did not escape the notice
of Amasis, who was much disturbed thereat. When therefore his
successes continued increasing, Amasis wrote him the following letter,
and sent it to Samos. "Amasis to Polycrates thus sayeth: It is a
pleasure to hear of a friend and ally prospering, but thy exceeding
prosperity does not cause me joy, forasmuch as I know that the gods
are envious. My wish for myself and for those whom I love is to be now
successful, and now to meet with a check; thus passing through life
amid alternate good and ill, rather than with perpetual good
fortune. For never yet did I hear tell of any one succeeding in all
his undertakings, who did not meet with calamity at last, and come
to utter ruin. Now, therefore, give ear to my words, and meet thy good
luck in this way: bethink thee which of all thy treasures thou valuest
most and canst least bear to part with; take it, whatsoever it be, and
throw it away, so that it may be sure never to come any more into
the sight of man. Then, if thy good fortune be not thenceforth
chequered with ill, save thyself from harm by again doing as I have
counselled."

When Polycrates read this letter, and perceived that the advice of
Amasis was good, he considered carefully with himself which of the
treasures that he had in store it would grieve him most to lose. After
much thought he made up his mind that it was a signet-ring which he
was wont to wear, an emerald set in gold, the workmanship of Theodore,
son of Telecles, a Samian. So he determined to throw this away; and,
manning a penteconter, he went on board, and bade the sailors put
out into the open sea. When he was now a long way from the island,
he took the ring from his finger, and, in the sight of all those who
were on board, flung it into the deep. This done, he returned home,
and gave vent to his sorrow.

Now it happened five or six days afterwards that a fisherman
caught a fish so large and beautiful that he thought it well
deserved to be made a present of to the king. So he took it with him
to the gate of the palace, and said that he wanted to see
Polycrates. Then Polycrates allowed him to come in, and the
fisherman gave him the fish with these words following- "Sir king,
when I took this prize, I thought I would not carry it to market,
though I am a poor man who live by my trade. I said to myself, it is
worthy of Polycrates and his greatness; and so I brought it here to
give it to you." The speech pleased the king, who thus spoke in
reply:- "Thou didst right well, friend, and I am doubly indebted, both
for the gift, and for the speech. Come now, and sup with me." So the
fisherman went home, esteeming it a high honour that he had been asked
to sup with the king. Meanwhile the servants, on cutting open the
fish, found the signet of their master in its belly. No sooner did
they see it than they seized upon it, and hastening to Polycrates with
great joy, restored it to him, and told him in what way it had been
found. The king, who saw something providential in the matter,
forthwith wrote a letter to Amasis, telling him all that had happened,
what he had himself done, and what had been the upshot- and despatched
the letter to Egypt.

When Amasis had read the letter of Polycrates, he perceived that
it does not belong to man to save his fellow-man from the fate which
is in store for him; likewise he felt certain that Polycrates would
end ill, as he prospered in everything, even finding what he had
thrown away. So he sent a herald to Samos, and dissolved the
contract of friendship. This he did, that when the great and heavy
misfortune came, he might escape the grief which he would have felt if
the sufferer had been his bond-friend.

It was with this Polycrates, so fortunate in every undertaking,
that the Lacedaemonians now went to war. Certain Samians, the same who
afterwards founded the city of Cydonia in Crete, had earnestly
intreated their help. For Polycrates, at the time when Cambyses, son
of Cyrus, was gathering together an armament against Egypt, had sent
to beg him not to omit to ask aid from Samos; whereupon Cambyses
with much readiness despatched a messenger to the island, and made
request that Polycrates would give some ships to the naval force which
he was collecting against Egypt. Polycrates straightway picked out
from among the citizens such as he thought most likely to stir
revolt against him, and manned with them forty triremes, which he sent
to Cambyses, bidding him keep the men safe, and never allow them to
return home.

Now some accounts say that these Samians did not reach Egypt;
for that when they were off Carpathus, they took counsel together
and resolved to sail no further. But others maintain that they did
go to Egypt, and, finding themselves watched, deserted, and sailed
back to Samos. There Polycrates went out against them with his
fleet, and a battle was fought and gained by the exiles; after which
they disembarked upon the island and engaged the land forces of
Polycrates, but were defeated, and so sailed off to Lacedaemon. Some
relate that the Samians from Egypt overcame Polycrates, but it seems
to me untruly; for had the Samians been strong enough to conquer
Polycrates by themselves, they would not have needed to call in the
aid of the Lacedaemonians. And moreover, it is not likely that a
king who had in his pay so large a body of foreign mercenaries, and
maintained likewise such a force of native bowmen, would have been
worsted by an army so small as that of the returned Samians. As for
his own subjects, to hinder them from betraying him and joining the
exiles, Polycrates shut up their wives and children in the sheds built
to shelter his ships, and was ready to burn sheds and all in case of
need.

When the banished Samians reached Sparta, they had audience of the
magistrates, before whom they made a long speech, as was natural
with persons greatly in want of aid. Accordingly at this first sitting
the Spartans answered them that they had forgotten the first half of
their speech, and could make nothing of the remainder. Afterwards
the Samians had another audience, whereat they simply said, showing
a bag which they had brought with them, "The bag wants flour." The
Spartans answered that they did not need to have said "the bag";
however, they resolved to give them aid.

Then the Lacedaemonians made ready and set forth to the attack
of Samos, from a motive of gratitude, if we may believe the Samians,
because the Samians had once sent ships to their aid against the
Messenians; but as the Spartans themselves say, not so much from any
wish to assist the Samians who begged their help, as from a desire
to punish the people who had seized the bowl which they sent to
Croesus, and the corselet which Amasis, king of Egypt, sent as a
present to them. The Samians made prize of this corselet the year
before they took the bowl- it was of linen, and had a vast number of
figures of animals inwoven into its fabric, and was likewise
embroidered with gold and tree-wool. What is most worthy of admiration
in it is that each of the twists, although of fine texture, contains
within it three hundred and sixty threads, all of them clearly
visible. The corselet which Amasis gave to the temple of Minerva in
Lindus is just such another.

The Corinthians likewise right willingly lent a helping hand
towards the expedition against Samos; for a generation earlier,
about the time of the seizure of the wine-bowl, they too had
suffered insult at the hands of the Samians. It happened that
Periander, son of Cypselus, had taken three hundred boys, children
of the chief nobles among the Corcyraeans, and sent them to Alyattes
for eunuchs; the men who had them in charge touched at Samos on
their way to Sardis; whereupon the Samians, having found out what
was to become of the boys when they reached that city, first
prompted them to take sanctuary at the temple of Diana; and after
this, when the Corinthians, as they were forbidden to tear the
suppliants from the holy place, sought to cut off from them all
supplies of food, invented a festival in their behalf, which they
celebrate to this day with the selfsame rites. Each evening, as
night closed in, during the whole time that the boys continued
there, choirs of youths and virgins were placed about the temple,
carrying in their hands cakes made of sesame and honey, in order
that the Corcyraean boys might snatch the cakes, and so get enough
to live upon.

And this went on for so long, that at last the Corinthians who had
charge of the boys gave them up, and took their departure, upon
which the Samians conveyed them back to Corcyra. If now, after the
death of Periander, the Corinthians and Corcyraeans had been good
friends, it is not to be imagined that the former would ever have
taken part in the expedition against Samos for such a reason as
this; but as, in fact, the two people have always, ever since the
first settlement of the island, been enemies to one another, this
outrage was remembered, and the Corinthians bore the Samians a
grudge for it. Periander had chosen the youths from among the first
families in Corcyra, and sent them a present to Alyattes, to avenge
a wrong which he had received. For it was the Corcyraeans who began
the quarrel and injured Periander by an outrage of a horrid nature.

After Periander had put to death his wife Melissa, it chanced that
on this first affliction a second followed of a different kind. His
wife had borne him two sons, and one of them had now reached the age
of seventeen, the other of eighteen years, when their mother's father,
Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, asked them to his court. They went,
and Procles treated them with much kindness, as was natural,
considering they were his own daughter's children. At length, when the
time for parting came, Procles, as he was sending them on their way,
said, "Know you now, my children, who it was that caused your mother's
death?" The elder son took no account of this speech, but the younger,
whose name was Lycophron, was sorely troubled at it- so much so,
that when he got back to Corinth, looking upon his father as his
mother's murderer, he would neither speak to him, nor answer when
spoken to, nor utter a word in reply to all his questionings. So
Periander at last, growing furious at such behaviour, banished him
from his house.

The younger son gone, he turned to the elder and asked him,
"what it was that their grandfather had said to them?" Then he related
in how kind and friendly a fashion he had received them; but, not
having taken any notice of the speech which Procles had uttered at
parting, he quite forgot to mention it. Periander insisted that it was
not possible this should be all- their grandfather must have given
them some hint or other- and he went on pressing him, till at last the
lad remembered the parting speech and told it. Periander, after he had
turned the whole matter over in his thoughts, and felt unwilling to
give way at all, sent a messenger to the persons who had opened
their houses to his outcast son, and forbade them to harbour him. Then
the boy, when he was chased from one friend, sought refuge with
another, but was driven from shelter to shelter by the threats of
his father, who menaced all those that took him in, and commanded them
to shut their doors against him. Still, as fast as he was forced to
leave one house he went to another, and was received by the inmates;
for his acquaintance, although in no small alarm, yet gave him
shelter, as he was Periander's son.

At last Periander made proclamation that whoever harboured his son
or even spoke to him, should forfeit a certain sum of money to Apollo.
On hearing this no one any longer liked to take him in, or even to
hold converse with him, and he himself did not think it right to
seek to do what was forbidden; so, abiding by his resolve, he made his
lodging in the public porticos. When four days had passed in this way,
Periander, secing how wretched his son was, that he neither washed nor
took any food, felt moved with compassion towards him; wherefore,
foregoing his anger, he approached him, and said, "Which is better,
oh! my son, to fare as now thou farest, or to receive my crown and all
the good things that I possess, on the one condition of submitting
thyself to thy father? See, now, though my own child, and lord of this
wealthy Corinth, thou hast brought thyself to a beggar's life, because
thou must resist and treat with anger him whom it least behoves thee
to oppose. If there has been a calamity, and thou bearest me ill
will on that account, bethink thee that I too feel it, and am the
greatest sufferer, in as much as it was by me that the deed was
done. For thyself, now that thou knowest how much better a thing it is
to be envied than pitied, and how dangerous it is to indulge anger
against parents and superiors, come back with me to thy home." With
such words as these did Periander chide his son; but the son made no
reply, except to remind his father that he was indebted to the god
in the penalty for coming and holding converse with him. Then
Periander knew that there was no cure for the youth's malady, nor
means of overcoming it; so he prepared a ship and sent him away out of
his sight to Corcyra, which island at that time belonged to him. As
for Procles, Periander, regarding him as the true author of all his
present troubles, went to war with him as soon as his son was gone,
and not only made himself master of his kingdom Epidaurus, but also
took Procles himself, and carried him into captivity.

As time went on, and Periander came to be old, he found himself no
longer equal to the oversight and management of affairs. Seeing,
therefore, in his eldest son no manner of ability, but knowing him
to be dull and blockish, he sent to Corcyra and recalled Lycophron
to take the kingdom. Lycophron, however, did not even deign to ask the
bearer of this message a question. But Periander's heart was set
upon the youth, so he sent again to him, this time by his own
daughter, the sister of Lycophron, who would, he thought, have more
power to persuade him than any other person. Then she, when she
reached Corcyra, spoke thus with her brother:- "Dost thou wish the
kingdom, brother, to pass into strange hands, and our father's
wealth to be made a prey, rather than thyself return to enjoy it? Come
back home with me, and cease to punish thyself. It is scant gain, this
obstinacy. Why seek to cure evil by evil? Mercy, remember, is by
many set above justice. Many, also, while pushing their mother's
claims have forfeited their father's fortune. Power is a slippery
thing- it has many suitors; and he is old and stricken in years- let
not thy own inheritance go to another." Thus did the sister, who had
been tutored by Periander what to say, urge all the arguments most
likely to have weight with her brother. He however made answer,
"That so long as he knew his father to be still alive, he would
never go back to Corinth." When the sister brought Periander this
reply, he sent his son a third time by a herald, and said he would
come himself to Corcyra, and let his son take his place at Corinth
as heir to his kingdom. To these terms Lycophron agreed; and Periander
was making ready to pass into Corcyra and his son to return to
Corinth, when the Corcyraeans, being informed of what was taking
place, to keep Periander away, put the young man to death. For this
reason it was that Periander took vengeance on the Corcyraeans.

The Lacedaemonians arrived before Samos with a mighty armament,
and forthwith laid siege to the place. In one of the assaults upon the
walls, they forced their way to the top of the tower which stands by
the sea on the side where the suburb is, but Polycrates came in person
to the rescue with a strong force, and beat them back. Meanwhile at
the upper tower, which stood on the ridge of the hill, the besieged,
both mercenaries and Samians, made a sally; but after they had
withstood the Lacedaemonians a short time, they fled backwards, and
the Lacedaemonians, pressing upon them, slew numbers.

If now all who were present had behaved that day like Archias
and Lycopas, two of the Lacedaemonians, Samos might have been taken.
For these two heroes, following hard upon the flying Samians,
entered the city along with them, and, being all alone, and their
retreat cut off, were slain within the walls of the place. I myself
once fell in with the grandson of this Archias, a man named Archias
like his grandsire, and the son of Samius, whom I met at Pitana, to
which canton he belonged. He respected the Samians beyond all other
foreigners, and he told me that his father was called Samius,
because his grandfather Archias died in Samos so gloriously, and
that the reason why he respected the Samians so greatly was that his
grandsire was buried with public honours by the Samian people.

The Lacedaemonians besieged Samos during forty days, but not
making any progress before the place, they raised the siege at the end
of that time, and returned home to the Peloponnese. There is a silly
tale told that Polycrates struck a quantity of the coin of his country
in lead, and, coating it with gold, gave it to the Lacedaemonians, who
on receiving it took their departure.

This was the first expedition into Asia of the Lacedaemonian
Dorians.

The Samians who had fought against Polycrates, when they knew that
the Lacedaemonians were about to forsake them, left Samos
themselves, and sailed to Siphnos. They happened to be in want of
money; and the Siphnians at that time were at the height of their
greatness, no islanders having so much wealth as they. There were
mines of gold and silver in their country, and of so rich a yield,
that from a tithe of the ores the Siphnians furnished out a treasury
at Delphi which was on a par with the grandest there. What the mines
yielded was divided year by year among the citizens. At the time
when they formed the treasury, the Siphnians consulted the oracle, and
asked whether their good things would remain to them many years. The
Pythoness made answer as follows:-


When the Prytanies'seat shines white in the island of Siphnos,

White-browed all the forum-need then of a true seer's wisdom-

Danger will threat from a wooden host, and a herald in scarlet.

Now about this time the forum of the Siphnians and their townhall or
prytaneum had been adorned with Parian marble.

The Siphnians, however, were unable to understand the oracle,
either at the time when it was given, or afterwards on the arrival
of the Samians. For these last no sooner came to anchor off the island
than they sent one of their vessels, with an ambassage on board, to
the city. All ships in these early times were painted with
vermilion; and this was what the Pythoness had meant when she told
them to beware of danger "from a wooden host, and a herald in
scarlet." So the ambassadors came ashore and besought the Siphnians to
lend them ten talents; but the Siphnians refused, whereupon the
Samians began to plunder their lands. Tidings of this reached the
Siphnians, who straightway sallied forth to save their crops; then a
battle was fought, in which the Siphnians suffered defeat, and many of
their number were cut off from the city by the Samians, after which
these latter forced the Siphnians to give them a hundred talents.

With this money they bought of the Hermionians the island of
Hydrea, off the coast of the Peloponnese, and this they gave in
trust to the Troezenians, to keep for them, while they themselves went
on to Crete, and founded the city of Cydonia. They had not meant, when
they set sail, to settle there, but only to drive out the
Zacynthians from the island. However they rested at Cydonia, where
they flourished greatly for five years. It was they who built the
various temples that may still be seen at that place, and among them
the fane of Dictyna. But in the sixth year they were attacked by the
Eginetans, who beat them in a sea-fight, and, with the help of the
Cretans, reduced them all to slavery. The beaks of their ships,
which carried the figure of a wild boar, they sawed off, and laid them
up in the temple of Minerva in Egina. The Eginetans took part
against the Samians on account of an ancient grudge, since the Samians
had first, when Amphicrates was king of Samos, made war on them and
done great harm to their island, suffering, however, much damage
also themselves. Such was the reason which moved the Eginetans to make
this attack.

I have dwelt the longer on the affairs of the Samians, because
three of the greatest works in all Greece were made by them. One is
a tunnel, under a hill one hundred and fifty fathoms high, carried
entirely through the base of the hill, with a mouth at either end. The
length of the cutting is seven furlongs- the height and width are each
eight feet. Along the whole course there is a second cutting, twenty
cubits deep and three feet broad, whereby water is brought, through
pipes, from an abundant source into the city. The architect of this
tunnel was Eupalinus, son of Naustrophus, a Megarian. Such is the
first of their great works; the second is a mole in the sea, which
goes all round the harbour, near twenty fathoms deep, and in length
above two furlongs. The third is a temple; the largest of all the
temples known to us, whereof Rhoecus, son of Phileus, a Samian, was
first architect. Because of these works I have dwelt the longer on the
affairs of Samos.

While Cambyses, son of Cyrus, after losing his senses, still
lingered in Egypt, two Magi, brothers, revolted against him. One of
them had been left in Persia by Cambyses as comptroller of his
household; and it was he who began the revolt. Aware that Smerdis
was dead, and that his death was hid and known to few of the Persians,
while most believed that he was still alive, he laid his plan, and
made a bold stroke for the crown. He had a brother- the same of whom I
spoke before as his partner in the revolt- who happened greatly to
resemble Smerdis the son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses his brother had put
to death. And not only was this brother of his like Smerdis in person,
but he also bore the selfsame name, to wit Smerdis. Patizeithes, the
other Magus, having persuaded him that he would carry the whole
business through, took him and made him sit upon the royal throne.
Having so done, he sent heralds through all the land, to Egypt and
elsewhere, to make proclamation to the troops that henceforth they
were to obey Smerdis the son of Cyrus, and not Cambyses.

The other heralds therefore made proclamation as they were
ordered, and likewise the herald whose place it was to proceed into
Egypt. He, when he reached Agbatana in Syria, finding Cambyses and his
army there, went straight into the middle of the host, and standing
forth before them all, made the proclamation which Patizeithes the
Magus had commanded. Cambyses no sooner heard him, than believing that
what the herald said was true, and imagining that he had been betrayed
by Prexaspes (who, he supposed, had not put Smerdis to death when sent
into Persia for that purpose), he turned his eyes full upon Prexaspes,
and said, "Is this the way, Prexaspes, that thou didst my errand?"
"Oh! my liege," answered the other, "there is no truth in the
tidings that Smerdis thy brother has revolted against thee, nor hast
thou to fear in time to come any quarrel, great or small, with that
man. With my own hands I wrought thy will on him, and with my own
hands I buried him. If of a truth the dead can leave their graves,
expect Astyages the Mede to rise and fight against thee; but if the
course of nature be the same as formerly, then be sure no ill will
ever come upon thee from this quarter. Now, therefore, my counsel is
that we send in pursuit of the herald, and strictly question him who
it was that charged him to bid us obey king Smerdis."

When Prexaspes had so spoken, and Cambyses had approved his words,
the herald was forthwith pursued, and brought back to the king. Then
Prexaspes said to him, "Sirrah, thou bear'st us a message, sayst thou,
from Smerdis, son of Cyrus. Now answer truly, and go thy way
scathless. Did Smerdis have thee to his presence and give thee thy
orders, or hadst thou them from one of his officers?" The herald
answered, "Truly I have not set eyes on Smerdis son of Cyrus, since
the day when king Cambyses led the Persians into Egypt. The man who
gave me my orders was the Magus that Cambyses left in charge of the
household; but he said that Smerdis son of Cyrus sent you the
message." In all this the herald spoke nothing but the strict truth.
Then Cambyses said thus to Prexaspes:- "Thou art free from all
blame, Prexaspes, since, as a right good man, thou hast not failed
to do the thing which I commanded. But tell me now, which of the
Persians can have taken the name of Smerdis, and revolted from me?" "I
think, my liege," he answered, "that I apprehend the whole business.
The men who have risen in revolt against thee are the two Magi,
Patizeithes, who was left comptroller of thy household, and his
brother, who is named Smerdis."

Cambyses no sooner heard the name of Smerdis than he was struck
with the truth of Prexaspes' words, and the fulfilment of his own
dream- the dream, I mean, which he had in former days, when one
appeared to him in his sleep and told him that Smerdis sate upon the
royal throne, and with his head touched the heavens. So when he saw
that he had needlessly slain his brother Smerdis, he wept and bewailed
his loss: after which, smarting with vexation as he thought of all his
ill luck, he sprang hastily upon his steed, meaning to march his
army with all haste to Susa against the Magus. As he made his
spring, the button of his sword-sheath fell off, and the bared point
entered his thigh, wounding him exactly where he had himself once
wounded the Egyptian god Apis. Then Cambyses, feeling that he had
got his death-wound, inquired the name of the place where he was,
and was answered, "Agbatana." Now before this it had been told him
by the oracle at Buto that he should end his days at Agbatana. He,
however, had understood the Median Agbatana, where all his treasures
were, and had thought that he should die there in a good old age;
but the oracle meant Agbatana in Syria. So when Cambyses heard the
name of the place, the double shock that he had received, from the
revolt of the Magus and from his wound, brought him back to his
senses. And he understood now the true meaning of the oracle, and
said, "Here then Cambyses, son of Cyrus, is doomed to die."

At this time he said no more; but twenty days afterwards he called
to his presence all the chief Persians who were with the army, and
addressed them as follows:- "Persians, needs must I tell you now
what hitherto I have striven with the greatest care to keep concealed.
When I was in Egypt I saw in my sleep a vision, which would that I had
never beheld! I thought a messenger came to me from my home, and
told me that Smerdis sate upon the royal throne, and with his head
touched the heavens. Then I feared to be cast from my throne by
Smerdis my brother, and I did what was more hasty than wise. Ah!
truly, do what they may, it is impossible for men to turn aside the
coming fate. I, in my folly, sent Prexaspes to Susa to put my
brother to death. So this great woe was accomplished, and I then lived
without fear, never imagining that, after Smerdis was dead, I need
dread revolt from any other. But herein I had quite mistaken what
was about to happen, and so I slew my brother without any need, and
nevertheless have lost my crown. For it was Smerdis the Magus, and not
Smerdis my brother, of whose rebellion God forewarned me by the
vision. The deed is done, however, and Smerdis, son of Cyrus, be
sure is lost to you. The Magi have the royal power- Patizeithes,
whom I left at Susa to overlook my household, and Smerdis his brother.
There was one who would have been bound beyond all others to avenge
the wrongs I have suffered from these Magians, but he, alas! has
perished by a horrid fate, deprived of life by those nearest and
dearest to him. In his default, nothing now remains for me but to tell
you, O Persians, what I would wish to have done after I have
breathed my last. Therefore, in the name of the gods that watch over
our royal house, I charge you all, and specially such of you as are
Achaemenids, that ye do not tamely allow the kingdom to go back to the
Medes. Recover it one way or another, by force or fraud; by fraud,
if it is by fraud that they have seized on it; by force, if force
has helped them in their enterprise. Do this, and then may your land
bring you forth fruit abundantly, and your wives bear children, and
your herds increase, and freedom be your portion for ever: but do it
not- make no brave struggle to regain the kingdom- and then my curse
be on you, and may the opposite of all these things happen to you- and
not only so, but may you, one and all, perish at the last by such a
fate as mine!" Then Cambyses, when he left speaking, bewailed his
whole misfortune from beginning to end.

Whereupon the Persians, seeing their king weep, rent the
garments that they had on, and uttered lamentable cries; after
which, as the bone presently grew carious, and the limb gangrened,
Cambyses, son of Cyrus, died. He had reigned in all seven years and
five months, and left no issue behind him, male or female. The
Persians who had heard his words, put no faith in anything that he
said concerning the Magi having the royal power; but believed that
he spoke out of hatred towards Smerdis, and had invented the tale of
his death to cause the whole Persian race to rise up in arms against
him. Thus they were convinced that it was Smerdis the son of Cyrus who
had rebelled and now sate on the throne. For Prexaspes stoutly
denied that he had slain Smerdis, since it was not safe for him, after
Cambyses was dead, to allow that a son of Cyrus had met with death
at his hands.

Thus then Cambyses died, and the Magus now reigned in security,
and passed himself off for Smerdis the son of Cyrus. And so went by
the seven months which were wanting to complete the eighth year of
Cambyses. His subjects, while his reign lasted, received great
benefits from him, insomuch that, when he died, all the dwellers in
Asia mourned his loss exceedingly, except only the Persians. For no
sooner did he come to the throne than forthwith he sent round to every
nation under his rule, and granted them freedom from war-service and
from taxes for the space of three years.

In the eighth month, however, it was discovered who he was in
the mode following. There was a man called Otanes, the son of
Pharnaspes, who for rank and wealth was equal to the greatest of the
Persians. This Otanes was the first to suspect that the Magus was
not Smerdis the son of Cyrus, and to surmise moreover who he really
was. He was led to guess the truth by the king never quitting the
citadel, and never calling before him any of the Persian noblemen.
As soon, therefore, as his suspicions were aroused he adopted the
following measures:- One of his daughters, who was called Phaedima,
had been married to Cambyses, and was taken to wife, together with the
rest of Cambyses' wives, by the Magus. To this daughter Otanes sent
a message, and inquired of her "who it was whose bed she shared,-
was it Smerdis the son of Cyrus, or was it some other man?" Phaedima
in reply declared she did not know- Smerdis the son of Cyrus she had
never seen, and so she could not tell whose bed she shared. Upon
this Otanes sent a second time, and said, "If thou dost not know
Smerdis son of Cyrus thyself, ask queen Atossa who it is with whom
ye both live- she cannot fail to know her own brother." To this the
daughter made answer, "I can neither get speech with Atossa, nor
with any of the women who lodge in the palace. For no sooner did
this man, be he who he may, obtain the kingdom, than he parted us from
one another, and gave us all separate chambers."

This made the matter seem still more plain to Otanes. Nevertheless
he sent a third message to his daughter in these words following:-
"Daughter, thou art of noble blood- thou wilt not shrink from a risk
which thy father bids thee encounter. If this fellow be not Smerdis
the son of Cyrus, but the man whom I think him to be, his boldness
in taking thee to be his wife, and lording it over the Persians,
must not be allowed to pass unpunished. Now therefore do as I command-
when next he passes the night with thee, wait till thou art sure he is
fast asleep, and then feel for his ears. If thou findest him to have
ears, then believe him to be Smerdis the son of Cyrus, but if he has
none, know him for Smerdis the Magian." Phaedima returned for
answer, "It would be a great risk. If he was without ears, and
caught her feeling for them, she well knew he would make away with
her- nevertheless she would venture." So Otanes got his daughter's
promise that she would do as he desired. Now Smerdis the Magian had
had his ears cut off in the lifetime of Cyrus son of Cambyses, as a
punishment for a crime of no slight heinousness. Phaedima therefore,
Otanes' daughter, bent on accomplishing what she had promised her
father, when her turn came, and she was taken to the bed of the
Magus (in Persia a man's wives sleep with him in their turns),
waited till he was sound asleep, and then felt for his ears. She
quickly perceived that he had no ears; and of this, as soon as day
dawned, she sent word to her father.

Then Otanes took to him two of the chief Persians, Aspathines
and Gobryas, men whom it was most advisable to trust in such a matter,
and told them everything. Now they had already of themselves suspected
how the matter stood. When Otanes therefore laid his reasons before
them they at once came into his views; and it was agreed that each
of the three should take as companion in the work the Persian in
whom he placed the greatest confidence. Then Otanes chose Intaphernes,
Gobryas Megabyzus, and Aspathines Hydarnes. After the number had
thus become six, Darius, the son of Hystaspes, arrived at Susa from
Persia, whereof his father was governor. On his coming it seemed
good to the six to take him likewise into their counsels.

After this, the men, being now seven in all, met together to
exchange oaths, and hold discourse with one another. And when it
came to the turn of Darius to speak his mind, he said as follows:-
"Methought no one but I knew that Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, was not
now alive, and that Smerdis the Magian ruled over us; on this
account I came hither with speed, to compass the death of the
Magian. But as it seems the matter is known to you all, and not to
me only, my judgment is that we should act at once, and not any longer
delay. For to do so were not well." Otanes spoke upon this:- "Son of
Hystaspes," said he, "thou art the child of a brave father, and
seemest likely to show thyself as bold a gallant as he. Beware,
however, of rash haste in this matter; do not hurry so, but proceed
with soberness. We must add to our number ere we adventure to strike
the blow." "Not so," Darius rejoined; "for let all present be well
assured that if the advice of Otanes guide our acts, we shall perish
most miserably. Some one will betray our plot to the Magians for
lucre's sake. Ye ought to have kept the matter to yourselves, and so
made the venture; but as ye have chosen to take others into your
secret, and have opened the matter to me, take my advice and make
the attempt today- or if not, if a single day be suffered to pass
by, be sure that I will let no one betray me to the Magian. I myself
will go to him, and plainly denounce you all."

Otanes, when he saw Darius so hot, replied, "But if thou wilt
force us to action, and not allow a day's delay, tell us, I pray thee,
how we shall get entrance into the palace, so as to set upon them.
Guards are placed everywhere, as thou thyself well knowest- for if
thou hast not seen, at least thou hast heard tell of them. How are
we to pass these guards, I ask thee?" answered Darius, "there are many
things easy enough in act, which by speech it is hard to explain.
There are also things concerning which speech is easy, but no noble
action follows when the speech is done. As for these guards, ye know
well that we shall not find it hard to make our way through them.
Our rank alone would cause them to allow us to enter- shame and fear
alike forbidding them to say us nay. But besides, I have the fairest
plea that can be conceived for gaining admission. I can say that I
have just come from Persia, and have a message to deliver to the
king from my father. An untruth must be spoken, where need requires.
For whether men lie, or say true, it is with one and the same
object. Men lie, because they think to gain by deceiving others; and
speak the truth, because they expect to get something by their true
speaking, and to be trusted afterwards in more important matters.
Thus, though their conduct is so opposite, the end of both is alike.
If there were no gain to be got, your true-speaking man would tell
untruths as much as your liar, and your liar would tell the truth as
much as your true-speaking man. The doorkeeper, who lets us in
readily, shall have his guerdon some day or other; but woe to the
man who resists us, he must forthwith be declared an enemy. Forcing
our way past him, we will press in and go straight to our work."

After Darius had thus said, Gobryas spoke as follows:- "Dear
friends, when will a fitter occasion offer for us to recover the
kingdom, or, if we are not strong enough, at least die in the attempt?
Consider that we Persians are governed by a Median Magus, and one,
too, who has had his ears cut off! Some of you were present when
Cambyses lay upon his deathbed- such, doubtless, remember what
curses he called down upon the Persians if they made no effort to
recover the kingdom. Then, indeed, we paid but little heed to what
he said, because we thought he spoke out of hatred to set us against
his brother. Now, however, my vote is that we do as Darius has
counselled- march straight in a body to the palace from the place
where we now are, and forthwith set upon the Magian." So Gobryas
spake, and the others all approved.

While the seven were thus taking counsel together, it so chanced
that the following events were happening:- The Magi had been
thinking what they had best do, and had resolved for many reasons to
make a friend of Prexaspes. They knew how cruelly he had been outraged
by Cambyses, who slew his son with an arrow; they were also aware that
it was by his hand that Smerdis the son of Cyrus fell, and that he was
the only person privy to that prince's death; and they further found
him to be held in the highest esteem by all the Persians. So they
called him to them, made him their friend, and bound him by a
promise and by oaths to keep silence about the fraud which they were
practising upon the Persians, and not discover it to any one; and they
pledged themselves that in this case they would give him thousands
of gifts of every sort and kind. So Prexaspes agreed, and the Magi,
when they found that they had persuaded him so far, went on to another
proposal, and said they would assemble the Persians at the foot of the
palace wall, and he should mount one of the towers and harangue them
from it, assuring them that Smerdis the son of Cyrus, and none but he,
ruled the land. This they bade him do, because Prexaspes was a man
of great weight with his countrymen, and had often declared in
public that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was still alive, and denied being
his murderer.

Prexaspes said he was quite ready to do their will in the
matter; so the Magi assembled the people, and placed Prexaspes upon
the top of the tower, and told him to make his speech. Then this
man, forgetting of set purpose all that the Magi had intreated him
to say, began with Achaeamenes, and traced down the descent of
Cyrus; after which, when he came to that king, he recounted all the
services that had been rendered by him to the Persians, from whence he
went on to declare the truth, which hitherto he had concealed, he
said, because it would not have been safe for him to make it known,
but now necessity was laid on him to disclose the whole. Then he
told how, forced to it by Cambyses, he had himself taken the life of
Smerdis, son of Cyrus, and how that Persia was now ruled by the
Magi. Last of all, with many curses upon the Persians if they did
not recover the kingdom, and wreak vengeance on the Magi, he threw
himself headlong from the tower into the abyss below. Such was the end
of Prexaspes, a man all his life of high repute among the Persians.

And now the seven Persians, having resolved that they would attack
the Magi without more delay, first offered prayers to the gods and
then set off for the palace, quite unacquainted with what had been
done by Prexaspes. The news of his doings reached them upon their way,
when they had accomplished about half the distance. Hereupon they
turned aside out of the road, and consulted together. Otanes and his
party said they must certainly put off the business, and not make
the attack when affairs were in such a ferment. Darius, on the other
hand, and his friends, were against any change of plan, and wished
to go straight on, and not lose a moment. Now, as they strove
together, suddenly there came in sight two pairs of vultures, and
seven pairs of hawks, pursuing them, and the hawks tore the vultures
both with their claws and bills. At this sight the seven with one
accord came in to the opinion of Darius, and encouraged by the omen
hastened on towards the palace.

At the gate they were received as Darius had foretold. The guards,
who had no suspicion that they came for any ill purpose, and held
the chief Persians in much reverence, let them pass without
difficulty- it seemed as if they were under the special protection
of the gods- none even asked them any question. When they were now
in the great court they fell in with certain of the eunuchs, whose
business it was to carry the king's messages, who stopped them and
asked what they wanted, while at the same time they threatened the
doorkeepers for having let them enter. The seven sought to press on,
but the eunuchs would not suffer them. Then these men, with cheers
encouraging one another, drew their daggers, and stabbing those who
strove to withstand them, rushed forward to the apartment of the
males.

Now both the Magi were at this time within, holding counsel upon
the matter of Prexaspes. So when they heard the stir among the
eunuchs, and their loud cries, they ran out themselves, to see what
was happening. Instantly perceiving their danger, they both flew to
arms; one had just time to seize his bow, the other got hold of his
lance; when straightway the fight began. The one whose weapon was
the bow found it of no service at all; the foe was too near, and the
combat too close to allow of his using it. But the other made a
stout defence with his lance, wounding two of the seven, Aspathines in
the leg, and Intaphernes in the eye. This wound did not kill
Intaphernes, but it cost him the sight of that eye. The other Magus,
when he found his bow of no avail, fled into a chamber which opened
out into the apartment of the males, intending to shut to the doors.
But two of the seven entered the room with him, Darius and Gobryas.
Gobryas seized the Magus and grappled with him, while Darius stood
over them, not knowing what to do; for it was dark, and he was
afraid that if he struck a blow he might kill Gobryas. Then Gobyras,
when he perceived that Darius stood doing nothing, asked him, "why his
hand was idle?" "I fear to hurt thee," he answered. "Fear not," said
Gobryas; "strike, though it be through both." Darius did as he
desired, drove his dagger home, and by good hap killed the Magus.

Thus were the Magi slain; and the seven, cutting off both the
heads, and leaving their own wounded in the palace, partly because
they were disabled, and partly to guard the citadel, went forth from
the gates with the heads in their hands, shouting and making an
uproar. They called out to all the Persians whom they met, and told
them what had happened, showing them the heads of the Magi, while at
the same time they slew every Magus who fell in their way. Then the
Persians, when they knew what the seven had done, and understood the
fraud of the Magi, thought it but just to follow the example set them,
and, drawing their daggers, they killed the Magi wherever they could
find any. Such was their fury, that, unless night had closed in, not a
single Magus would have been left alive. The Persians observe this day
with one accord, and keep it more strictly than any other in the whole
year. It is then that they hold the great festival, which they call
the Magophonia. No Magus may show himself abroad during the whole time
that the feast lasts; but all must remain at home the entire day.

And now when five days were gone, and the hubbub had settled down,
the conspirators met together to consult about the situation of
affairs. At this meeting speeches were made, to which many of the
Greeks give no credence, but they were made nevertheless. Otanes
recommended that the management of public affairs should be
entrusted to the whole nation. "To me," he said, "it seems
advisable, that we should no longer have a single man to rule over
us- the rule of one is neither good nor pleasant. Ye cannot have
forgotten to what lengths Cambyses went in his haughty tyranny, and
the haughtiness of the Magi ye have yourselves experienced. How indeed
is it possible that monarchy should be a well-adjusted thing, when
it allows a man to do as he likes without being answerable? Such
licence is enough to stir strange and unwonted thoughts in the heart
of the worthiest of men. Give a person this power, and straightway his
manifold good things puff him up with pride, while envy is so
natural to human kind that it cannot but arise in him. But pride and
envy together include all wickedness- both of them leading on to deeds
of savage violence. True it is that kings, possessing as they do all
that heart can desire, ought to be void of envy; but the contrary is
seen in their conduct towards the citizens. They are jealous of the
most virtuous among their subjects, and wish their death; while they
take delight in the meanest and basest, being ever ready to listen
to the tales of slanderers. A king, besides, is beyond all other men
inconsistent with himself. Pay him court in moderation, and he is
angry because you do not show him more profound respect- show him
profound respect, and he is offended again, because (as he says) you
fawn on him. But the worst of all is, that he sets aside the laws of
the land, puts men to death without trial, and subjects women to
violence. The rule of the many, on the other hand, has, in the first
place, the fairest of names, to wit, isonomy; and further it is free
from all those outrages which a king is wont to commit. There,
places are given by lot, the magistrate is answerable for what he
does, and measures rest with the commonalty. I vote, therefore, that
we do away with monarchy, and raise the people to power. For the
people are all in all."

Such were the sentiments of Otanes. Megabyzus spoke next, and
advised the setting up of an oligarchy:- "In all that Otanes has
said to persuade you to put down monarchy," he observed, "I fully
concur; but his recommendation that we should call the people to power
seems to me not the best advice. For there is nothing so void of
understanding, nothing so full of wantonness, as the unwieldy
rabble. It were folly not to be borne, for men, while seeking to
escape the wantonness of a tyrant, to give themselves up to the
wantonness of a rude unbridled mob. The tyrant, in all his doings,
at least knows what is he about, but a mob is altogether devoid of
knowledge; for how should there be any knowledge in a rabble,
untaught, and with no natural sense of what is right and fit? It
rushes wildly into state affairs with all the fury of a stream swollen
in the winter, and confuses everything. Let the enemies of the
Persians be ruled by democracies; but let us choose out from the
citizens a certain number of the worthiest, and put the government
into their hands. For thus both we ourselves shall be among the
governors, and power being entrusted to the best men, it is likely
that the best counsels will prevail in the state."

This was the advice which Megabyzus gave, and after him Darius
came forward, and spoke as follows:- "All that Megabyzus said
against democracy was well said, I think; but about oligarchy he did
not speak advisedly; for take these three forms of government-
democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy- and let them each be at their
best, I maintain that monarchy far surpasses the other two. What
government can possibly be better than that of the very best man in
the whole state? The counsels of such a man are like himself, and so
he governs the mass of the people to their heart's content; while at
the same time his measures against evil-doers are kept more secret
than in other states. Contrariwise, in oligarchies, where men vie with
each other in the service of the commonwealth, fierce enmities are apt
to arise between man and man, each wishing to be leader, and to
carry his own measures; whence violent quarrels come, which lead to
open strife, often ending in bloodshed. Then monarchy is sure to
follow; and this too shows how far that rule surpasses all others.
Again, in a democracy, it is impossible but that there will be
malpractices: these malpractices, however, do not lead to enmities,
but to close friendships, which are formed among those engaged in
them, who must hold well together to carry on their villainies. And so
things go on until a man stands forth as champion of the commonalty,
and puts down the evil-doers. Straightway the author of so great a
service is admired by all, and from being admired soon comes to be
appointed king; so that here too it is plain that monarchy is the best
government. Lastly, to sum up all in a word, whence, I ask, was it
that we got the freedom which we enjoy?- did democracy give it us,
or oligarchy, or a monarch? As a single man recovered our freedom
for us, my sentence is that we keep to the rule of one. Even apart
from this, we ought not to change the laws of our forefathers when
they work fairly; for to do so is not well."

Such were the three opinions brought forward at this meeting;
the four other Persians voted in favour of the last. Otanes, who
wished to give his countrymen a democracy, when he found the
decision against him, arose a second time, and spoke thus before the
assembly:- "Brother conspirators, it is plain that the king who is
to be chosen will be one of ourselves, whether we make the choice by
casting lots for the prize, or by letting the people decide which of
us they will have to rule over them, in or any other way. Now, as I
have neither a mind to rule nor to be ruled, I shall not enter the
lists with you in this matter. I withdraw, however, on one
condition- none of you shall claim to exercise rule over me or my seed
for ever." The six agreed to these terms, and Otanes withdraw and
stood aloof from the contest. And still to this day the family of
Otanes continues to be the only free family in Persia; those who
belong to it submit to the rule of the king only so far as they
themselves choose; they are bound, however, to observe the laws of the
land like the other Persians.

After this the six took counsel together, as to the fairest way of
setting up a king: and first, with respect to Otanes, they resolved,
that if any of their own number got the kingdom, Otanes and his seed
after him should receive year by year, as a mark of special honour,
a Median robe, and all such other gifts as are accounted the most
honourable in Persia. And these they resolved to give him, because
he was the man who first planned the outbreak, and who brought the
seven together. These privileges, therefore, were assigned specially
to Otanes. The following were made common to them all:- It was to be
free to each, whenever he pleased, to enter the palace unannounced,
unless the king were in the company of one of his wives; and the
king was to be bound to marry into no family excepting those of the
conspirators. Concerning the appointment of a king, the resolve to
which they came was the following:- They would ride out together
next morning into the skirts of the city, and he whose steed first
neighed after the sun was up should have the kingdom.

Now Darius had a groom, a sharp-witted knave, called Oebares.
After the meeting had broken up, Darius sent for him, and said,
"Oebares, this is the way in which the king is to be chosen- we are to
mount our horses, and the man whose horse first neighs after the sun
is up is to have the kingdom. If then you have any cleverness,
contrive a plan whereby the prize may fall to us, and not go to
another." "Truly, master," Oebares answered, "if it depends on this
whether thou shalt be king or no, set thine heart at ease, and fear
nothing: I have a charm which is sure not to fail." "If thou hast
really aught of the kind," said Darius, "hasten to get it ready. The
matter does not brook delay, for the trial is to be to-morrow." So
Oebares when he heard that, did as follows:- When night came, he
took one of the mares, the chief favourite of the horse which Darius
rode, and tethering it in the suburb, brought his master's horse to
the place; then, after leading him round and round the mare several
times, nearer and nearer at each circuit, he ended by letting them
come together.

And now, when the morning broke, the six Persians, according to
agreement, met together on horseback, and rode out to the suburb. As
they went along they neared the spot where the mare was tethered the
night before, whereupon the horse of Darius sprang forward and
neighed. just at the same time, though the sky was clear and bright,
there was a flash of lightning, followed by a thunderclap. It seemed
as if the heavens conspired with Darius, and hereby inaugurated him
king: so the five other nobles leaped with one accord from their
steeds, and bowed down before him and owned him for their king.

This is the account which some of the Persians gave of the
contrivance of Oebares; but there are others who relate the matter
differently. They say that in the morning he stroked the mare with his
hand, which he then hid in his trousers until the sun rose and the
horses were about to start, when he suddenly drew his hand forth and
put it to the nostrils of his master's horse, which immediately
snorted and neighed.

Thus was Darius, son of Hystaspes, appointed king; and, except the
Arabians, all they of Asia were subject to him; for Cyrus, and after
him Cambyses, had brought them all under. The Arabians were never
subject as slaves to the Persians, but had a league of friendship with
them from the time when they brought Cambyses on his way as he went
into Egypt; for had they been unfriendly the Persians could never have
made their invasion.

And now Darius contracted marriages of the first rank, according
to the notions of the Persians: to wit, with two daughters of Cyrus,
Atossa and Artystone; of whom, Atossa had been twice married before,
once to Cambyses, her brother, and once to the Magus, while the other,
Artystone, was a virgin. He married also Parmys, daughter of
Smerdis, son of Cyrus; and he likewise took to wife the daughter of
Otanes, who had made the discovery about the Magus. And now when his
power was established firmly throughout all the kingdoms, the first
thing that he did was to set up a carving in stone, which showed a man
mounted upon a horse, with an inscription in these words following:-
"Darius, son of Hystaspes, by aid of his good horse" (here followed
the horse's name), "and of his good groom Oebares, got himself the
kingdom of the Persians."

This he set up in Persia; and afterwards he proceeded to establish
twenty governments of the kind which the Persians call satrapies,
assigning to each its governor, and fixing the tribute which was to be
paid him by the several nations. And generally he joined together in
one satrapy the nations that were neighbours, but sometimes he
passed over the nearer tribes, and put in their stead those which were
more remote. The following is an account of these governments, and
of the yearly tribute which they paid to the king:- Such as brought
their tribute in silver were ordered to pay according to the
Babylonian talent; while the Euboic was the standard measure for
such as brought gold. Now the Babylonian talent contains seventy
Euboic minae. During all the reign of Cyrus, and afterwards when
Cambyses ruled, there were no fixed tributes, but the nations
severally brought gifts to the king. On account of this and other like
doings, the Persians say that Darius was a huckster, Cambyses a
master, and Cyrus a father; for Darius looked to making a gain in
everything; Cambyses was harsh and reckless; while Cyrus was gentle,
and procured them all manner of goods.

The Ionians, the Magnesians of Asia, the Aeolians, the Carians,
the Lycians, the Milyans, and the Pamphylians, paid their tribute in a
single sum, which was fixed at four hundred talents of silver. These
formed together the first satrapy.

The Mysians, Lydians, Lasonians, Cabalians, and Hygennians paid
the sum of five hundred talents. This was the second satrapy.

The Hellespontians, of the right coast as one enters the
straits, the Phrygians, the Asiatic Thracians, the Paphlagonians,
the Mariandynians' and the Syrians paid a tribute of three hundred and
sixty talents. This was the third satrapy.

The Cilicians gave three hundred and sixty white horses, one for
each day in the year, and five hundred talents of silver. Of this
sum one hundred and forty talents went to pay the cavalry which
guarded the country, while the remaining three hundred and sixty
were received by Darius. This was the fourth satrapy.

The country reaching from the city of Posideium (built by
Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus, on the confines of Syria and
Cilicia) to the borders of Egypt, excluding therefrom a district which
belonged to Arabia and was free from tax, paid a tribute of three
hundred and fifty talents. All Phoenicia, Palestine Syria, and Cyprus,
were herein contained. This was the fifth satrapy.

From Egypt, and the neighbouring parts of Libya, together with the
towns of Cyrene and Barca, which belonged to the Egyptian satrapy, the
tribute which came in was seven hundred talents. These seven hundred
talents did not include the profits of the fisheries of Lake Moeris,
nor the corn furnished to the troops at Memphis. Corn was supplied
to 120,000 Persians, who dwelt at Memphis in the quarter called the
White Castle, and to a number of auxiliaries. This was the sixth
satrapy.

The Sattagydians, the Gandarians, the Dadicae, and the Aparytae,
who were all reckoned together, paid a tribute of a hundred and
seventy talents. This was the seventh satrapy.

Susa, and the other parts of Cissia, paid three hundred talents.
This was the eighth satrapy.

From Babylonia, and the rest of Assyria, were drawn a thousand
talents of silver, and five hundred boy-eunuchs. This was the ninth
satrapy.

Agbatana, and the other parts of Media, together with the
Paricanians and Orthocorybantes, paid in all four hundred and fifty
talents. This was the tenth satrapy.

The Caspians, Pausicae, Pantimathi, and Daritae, were joined in
one government, and paid the sum of two hundred talents. This was
the eleventh satrapy.

From the Bactrian tribes as far as the Aegli the tribute
received was three hundred and sixty talents. This was the twelfth
satrapy.

From Pactyica, Armenia, and the countries reaching thence to the
Euxine, the sum drawn was four hundred talents. This was the
thirteenth satrapy.

The Sagartians, Sarangians, Thamanaeans, Utians, and Mycians,
together with the inhabitants of the islands in the Erythraean sea,
where the king sends those whom he banishes, furnished altogether a
tribute of six hundred talents. This was the fourteenth satrapy.

The Sacans and Caspians gave two hundred and fifty talents. This
was the fifteenth satrapy.

The Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, and Arians, gave three
hundred. This was the sixteenth satrapy.

The Paricanians and Ethiopians of Asia furnished a tribute of four
hundred talents. This was the seventeenth satrapy.

The Matienians, Saspeires, and Alarodians were rated to pay two
hundred talents. This was the eighteenth satrapy.

The Moschi, Tibareni, Macrones, Mosynoeci, and Mares had to pay
three hundred talents. This was the nineteenth satrapy.

The Indians, who are more numerous than any other nation with
which we are acquainted, paid a tribute exceeding that of every
other people, to wit, three hundred and sixty talents of gold-dust.
This was the twentieth satrapy.

If the Babylonian money here spoken of be reduced to the Euboic
scale, it will make nine thousand five hundred and forty such talents;
and if the gold be reckoned at thirteen times the worth of silver, the
Indian gold-dust will come to four thousand six hundred and eighty
talents. Add these two amounts together and the whole revenue which
came in to Darius year by year will be found to be in Euboic money
fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty talents, not to mention parts
of a talent.

Such was the revenue which Darius derived from Asia and a small
part of Libya. Later in his reign the sum was increased by the tribute
of the islands, and of the nations of Europe as far as Thessaly. The
Great King stores away the tribute which he receives after this
fashion- he melts it down, and, while it is in a liquid state, runs it
into earthen vessels, which are afterwards removed, leaving the
metal in a solid mass. When money is wanted, he coins as much of
this bullion as the occasion requires.

Such then were the governments, and such the amounts of tribute at
which they were assessed respectively. Persia alone has not been
reckoned among the tributaries- and for this reason, because the
country of the Persians is altogether exempt from tax. The following
peoples paid no settled tribute, but brought gifts to the king: first,
the Ethiopians bordering upon Egypt, who were reduced by Cambyses when
he made war on the long-lived Ethiopians, and who dwell about the
sacred city of Nysa, and have festivals in honour of Bacchus. The
grain on which they and their next neighbours feed is the same as that
used by the Calantian Indians. Their dwelling-houses are under ground.
Every third year these two nations brought- and they still bring to my
day- two choenices of virgin gold, two hundred logs of ebony, five
Ethiopian boys, and twenty elephant tusks. The Colchians, and the
neighbouring tribes who dwell between them and the Caucasus- for so
far the Persian rule reaches, while north of the Caucasus no one fears
them any longer- undertook to furnish a gift, which in my day was
still brought every fifth year, consisting of a hundred boys, and
the same number of maidens. The Arabs brought every year a thousand
talents of frankincense. Such were the gifts which the king received
over and above the tribute-money.

The way in which the Indians get the plentiful supply of gold
which enables them to furnish year by year so vast an amount of
gold-dust to the kind is the following:- eastward of India lies a
tract which is entirely sand. Indeed of all the inhabitants of Asia,
concerning whom anything certain is known, the Indians dwell the
nearest to the east, and the rising of the sun. Beyond them the
whole country is desert on account of the sand. The tribes of
Indians are numerous, and do not all speak the same language- some are
wandering tribes, others not. They who dwell in the marshes along
the river live on raw fish, which they take in boats made of reeds,
each formed out of a single joint. These Indians wear a dress of
sedge, which they cut in the river and bruise; afterwards they weave
it into mats, and wear it as we wear a breast-plate.

Eastward of these Indians are another tribe, called Padaeans,
who are wanderers, and live on raw flesh. This tribe is said to have
the following customs:- If one of their number be ill, man or woman,
they take the sick person, and if he be a man, the men of his
acquaintance proceed to put him to death, because, they say, his flesh
would be spoilt for them if he pined and wasted away with sickness.
The man protests he is not ill in the least; but his friends will
not accept his denial- in spite of all he can say, they kill him,
and feast themselves on his body. So also if a woman be sick, the
women, who are her friends, take her and do with her exactly the
same as the men. If one of them reaches to old age, about which
there is seldom any question, as commonly before that time they have
had some disease or other, and so have been put to death- but if a
man, notwithstanding, comes to be old, then they offer him in
sacrifice to their gods, and afterwards eat his flesh.

There is another set of Indians whose customs are very
different. They refuse to put any live animal to death, they sow no
corn, and have no dwelling-houses. Vegetables are their only food.
There is a plant which grows wild in their country, bearing seed,
about the size of millet-seed, in a calyx: their wont is to gather
this seed and having boiled it, calyx and all, to use it for food.
If one of them is attacked with sickness, he goes forth into the
wilderness, and lies down to die; no one has the least concern
either for the sick or for the dead.

All the tribes which I have mentioned live together like the brute
beasts: they have also all the same tint of skin, which approaches
that of the Ethiopians. Their country is a long way from Persia
towards the south: nor had king Darius ever any authority over them.

Besides these, there are Indians of another tribe, who border on
the city of Caspatyrus, and the country of Pactyica; these people
dwell northward of all the rest of the Indians, and follow nearly
the same mode of life as the Bactrians. They are more warlike than any
of the other tribes, and from them the men are sent forth who go to
procure the gold. For it is in this part of India that the sandy
desert lies. Here, in this desert, there live amid the sand great
ants, in size somewhat less than dogs, but bigger than foxes. The
Persian king has a number of them, which have been caught by the
hunters in the land whereof we are speaking. Those ants make their
dwellings under ground, and like the Greek ants, which they very
much resemble in shape, throw up sand-heaps as they burrow. Now the
sand which they throw up is full of gold. The Indians, when they go
into the desert to collect this sand, take three camels and harness
them together, a female in the middle and a male on either side, in
a leading-rein. The rider sits on the female, and they are
particular to choose for the purpose one that has but just dropped her
young; for their female camels can run as fast as horses, while they
bear burthens very much better.

As the Greeks are well acquainted with the shape of the camel, I
shall not trouble to describe it; but I shall mention what seems to
have escaped their notice. The camel has in its hind legs four
thigh-bones and four knee-joints.

When the Indians therefore have thus equipped themselves they
set off in quest of the gold, calculating the time so that they may be
engaged in seizing it during the most sultry part of the day, when the
ants hide themselves to escape the heat. The sun in those parts shines
fiercest in the morning, not, as elsewhere, at noonday; the greatest
heat is from the time when he has reached a certain height, until
the hour at which the market closes. During this space he burns much
more furiously than at midday in Greece, so that the men there are
said at that time to drench themselves with water. At noon his heat is
much the same in India as in other countries, after which, as the
day declines, the warmth is only equal to that of the morning sun
elsewhere. Towards evening the coolness increases, till about sunset
it becomes very cold.

When the Indians reach the place where the gold is, they fill
their bags with the sand, and ride away at their best speed: the ants,
however, scenting them, as the Persians say, rush forth in pursuit.
Now these animals are, they declare, so swift, that there is nothing
in the world like them: if it were not, therefore, that the Indians
get a start while the ants are mustering, not a single gold-gatherer
could escape. During the flight the male camels, which are not so
fleet as the females, grow tired, and begin to drag, first one, and
then the other; but the females recollect the young which they have
left behind, and never give way or flag. Such, according to the
Persians, is the manner in which the Indians get the greater part of
their gold; some is dug out of the earth, but of this the supply is
more scanty.

It seems as if the extreme regions of the earth were blessed by
nature with the most excellent productions, just in the same way
that Greece enjoys a climate more excellently tempered than any
other country. In India, which, as I observed lately, is the
furthest region of the inhabited world towards the east, all the
four-footed beasts and the birds are very much bigger than those found
elsewhere, except only the horses, which are surpassed by the Median
breed called the Nisaean. Gold too is produced there in vast
abundance, some dug from the earth, some washed down by the rivers,
some carried off in the mode which I have but now described. And
further, there are trees which grow wild there, the fruit whereof is a
wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that of sheep. The natives
make their clothes of this tree-wool.

Arabia is the last of inhabited lands towards the south, and it is
the only country which produces frankincense, myrrh, cassia, cinnamon,
and ledanum. The Arabians do not get any of these, except the myrrh,
without trouble. The frankincense they procure by means of the gum
styrax, which the Greeks obtain from the Phoenicians; this they
burn, and thereby obtain the spice. For the trees which bear the
frankincense are guarded by winged serpents, small in size, and of
varied colours, whereof vast numbers hang about every tree. They are
of the same kind as the serpents that invade Egypt; and there is
nothing but the smoke of the styrax which will drive them from the
trees.

The Arabians say that the whole world would swarm with these
serpents, if they were not kept in check in the way in which I know
that vipers are. Of a truth Divine Providence does appear to be, as
indeed one might expect beforehand, a wise contriver. For timid
animals which are a prey to others are all made to produce young
abundantly, that so the species may not be entirely eaten up and lost;
while savage and noxious creatures are made very unfruitful. The hare,
for instance, which is hunted alike by beasts, birds, and men,
breeds so abundantly as even to superfetate, a thing which is true
of no other animal. You find in a hare's belly, at one and the same
time, some of the young all covered with fur, others quite naked,
others again just fully formed in the womb, while the hare perhaps has
lately conceived afresh. The lioness, on the other hand, which is
one of the strongest and boldest of brutes, brings forth young but
once in her lifetime, and then a single cub; she cannot possibly
conceive again, since she loses her womb at the same time that she
drops her young. The reason of this is that as soon as the cub
begins to stir inside the dam, his claws, which are sharper than those
of any other animal, scratch the womb; as the time goes on, and he
grows bigger, he tears it ever more and more; so that at last, when
the birth comes, there is not a morsel in the whole womb that is
sound.

Now with respect to the vipers and the winged snakes of Arabia, if
they increased as fast as their nature would allow, impossible were it
for man to maintain himself upon the earth. Accordingly it is found
that when the male and female come together, at the very moment of
impregnation, the female seizes the male by the neck, and having
once fastened, cannot be brought to leave go till she has bit the neck
entirely through. And so the male perishes; but after a while he is
revenged upon the female by means of the young, which, while still
unborn, gnaw a passage through the womb, and then through the belly of
their mother, and so make their entrance into the world. Contrariwise,
other snakes, which are harmless, lay eggs, and hatch a vast number of
young. Vipers are found in all parts of the world, but the winged
serpents are nowhere seen except in Arabia, where they are all
congregated together. This makes them appear so numerous.

Such, then, is the way in which the Arabians obtain their
frankincense; their manner of collecting the cassia is the following:-
They cover all their body and their face with the hides of oxen and
other skins, leaving only holes for the eyes, and thus protected go in
search of the cassia, which grows in a lake of no great depth. All
round the shores and in the lake itself there dwell a number of winged
animals, much resembling bats, which screech horribly, and are very
valiant. These creatures they must keep from their eyes all the
while that they gather the cassia.

Still more wonderful is the mode in which they collect the
cinnamon. Where the wood grows, and what country produces it, they
cannot tell- only some, following probability, relate that it comes
from the country in which Bacchus was brought up. Great birds, they
say, bring the sticks which we Greeks, taking the word from the
Phoenicians, call cinnamon, and carry them up into the air to make
their nests. These are fastened with a sort of mud to a sheer face
of rock, where no foot of man is able to climb. So the Arabians, to
get the cinnamon, use the following artifice. They cut all the oxen
and asses and beasts of burthen that die in their land into large
pieces, which they carry with them into those regions, and Place
near the nests: then they withdraw to a distance, and the old birds,
swooping down, seize the pieces of meat and fly with them up to
their nests; which, not being able to support the weight, break off
and fall to the ground. Hereupon the Arabians return and collect the
cinnamon, which is afterwards carried from Arabia into other
countries.

Ledanum, which the Arabs call ladanum, is procured in a yet
stranger fashion. Found in a most inodorous place, it is the
sweetest-scented of all substances. It is gathered from the beards
of he-goats, where it is found sticking like gum, having come from the
bushes on which they browse. It is used in many sorts of unguents, and
is what the Arabs burn chiefly as incense.

Concerning the spices of Arabia let no more be said. The whole
country is scented with them, and exhales an odour marvellously sweet.
There are also in Arabia two kinds of sheep worthy of admiration,
the like of which is nowhere else to be seen; the one kind has long
tails, not less than three cubits in length, which, if they were
allowed to trail on the ground, would be bruised and fall into
sores. As it is, all the shepherds know enough of carpentering to make
little trucks for their sheep's tails. The trucks are placed under the
tails, each sheep having one to himself, and the tails are then tied
down upon them. The other kind has a broad tail, which is a cubit
across sometimes.

Where the south declines towards the setting sun lies the
country called Ethiopia, the last inhabited land in that direction.
There gold is obtained in great plenty, huge elephants abound, with
wild trees of all sorts, and ebony; and the men are taller, handsomer,
and longer lived than anywhere else.

Now these are the farthest regions of the world in Asia and Libya.
Of the extreme tracts of Europe towards the west I cannot speak with
any certainty; for I do not allow that there is any river, to which
the barbarians give the name of Eridanus, emptying itself into the
northern sea, whence (as the tale goes) amber is procured; nor do I
know of any islands called the Cassiterides (Tin Islands), whence
the tin comes which we use. For in the first place the name Eridanus
is manifestly not a barbarian word at all, but a Greek name,
invented by some poet or other; and secondly, though I have taken vast
pains, I have never been able to get an assurance from an
eye-witness that there is any sea on the further side of Europe.
Nevertheless, tin and amber do certainly come to us from the ends of
the earth.

The northern parts of Europe are very much richer in gold than any
other region: but how it is procured I have no certain knowledge.
The story runs that the one-eyed Arimaspi purloin it from the
griffins; but here too I am incredulous, and cannot persuade myself
that there is a race of men born with one eye, who in all else
resemble the rest of mankind. Nevertheless it seems to be true that
the extreme regions of the earth, which surround and shut up within
themselves all other countries, produce the things which are the
rarest, and which men reckon the most beautiful.

There is a plain in Asia which is shut in on all sides by a
mountain-range, and in this mountain-range are five openings. The
plain lies on the confines of the Chorasmians, Hyrcanians,
Parthians, Sarangians, and Thamanaeans, and belonged formerly to the
first-mentioned of those peoples. Ever since the Persians, however,
obtained the mastery of Asia, it has been the property of the Great
King. A mighty river, called the Aces, flows from the hills
inclosing the plain; and this stream, formerly splitting into five
channels, ran through the five openings in the hills, and watered
the lands of the five nations which dwell around. The Persian came,
however, and conquered the region, and then it went ill with the
people of these lands. The Great King blocked up all the passages
between the hills with dykes and flood gates, and so prevented the
water from flowing out. Then the plain within the hills became a
sea, for the river kept rising, and the water could find no outlet.
>From that time the five nations which were wont formerly to have the
use of the stream, losing their accustomed supply of water, have
been in great distress. In winter, indeed, they have rain from
heaven like the rest of the world, but in summer, after sowing their
millet and their sesame, they always stand in need of water from the
river. When, therefore, they suffer from this want, hastening to
Persia, men and women alike, they take their station at the gate of
the king's palace, and wail aloud. Then the king orders the
flood-gates to be opened towards the country whose need is greatest,
and lets the soil drink until it has had enough; after which the gates
on this side are shut, and others are unclosed for the nation which,
of the remainder, needs it most. It has been told me that the king
never gives the order to open the gates till the suppliants have
paid him a large sum of money over and above the tribute.

Of the seven Persians who rose up against the Magus, one,
Intaphernes, lost his life very shortly after the outbreak, for an act
of insolence. He wished to enter the palace and transact a certain
business with the king. Now the law was that all those who had taken
part in the rising against the Magus might enter unannounced into
the king's presence, unless he happened to be in private with his
wife. So Intaphernes would not have any one announce him, but, as he
belonged to the seven, claimed it as his right to go in. The
doorkeeper, however, and the chief usher forbade his entrance, since
the king, they said, was with his wife. But Intaphernes thought they
told lies; so, drawing his scymitar, he cut off their noses and
their ears, and, hanging them on the bridle of his horse, put the
bridle round their necks, and so let them go.

Then these two men went and showed themselves to the king, and
told him how it had come to pass that they were thus treated. Darius
trembled lest it was by the common consent of the six that the deed
had been done; he therefore sent for them all in turn, and sounded
them to know if they approved the conduct of Intaphernes. When he
found by their answers that there had been no concert between him
and them, he laid hands on Intaphernes, his children, and all his near
kindred; strongly suspecting that he and his friends were about to
raise a revolt. When all had been seized and put in chains, as
malefactors condemned to death, the wife of Intaphernes came and stood
continually at the palace-gates, weeping and wailing sore. So Darius
after a while, seeing that she never ceased to stand and weep, was
touched with pity for her, and bade a messenger go to her and say,
"Lady, king Darius gives thee as a boon the life of one of thy
kinsmen- choose which thou wilt of the prisoners." Then she pondered
awhile before she answered, "If the king grants me the life of one
alone, I make choice of my brother." Darius, when he heard the
reply, was astonished, and sent again, saying, "Lady, the king bids
thee tell him why it is that thou passest by thy husband and thy
children, and preferrest to have the life of thy brother spared. He is
not so near to thee as thy children, nor so dear as thy husband."
She answered, "O king, if the gods will, I may have another husband
and other children when these are gone. But as my father and my mother
are no more, it is impossible that I should have another brother. This
was my thought when I asked to have my brother spared." Then it seemed
to Darius that the lady spoke well, and he gave her, besides the
life that she had asked, the life also of her eldest son, because he
was greatly pleased with her. But he slew all the rest. Thus one of
the seven died, in the way I have described, very shortly after the
insurrection.

About the time of Cambyses' last sickness, the following events
happened. There was a certain Oroetes, a Persian, whom Cyrus had
made governor of Sardis. This man conceived a most unholy wish. He had
never suffered wrong or had an ill word from Polycrates the Samian-
nay, he had not so much as seen him in all his life; yet,
notwithstanding, he conceived the wish to seize him and put him to
death. This wish, according to the account which the most part give,
arose from what happened one day as he was sitting with another
Persian in the gate of the king's palace. The man's name was
Mitrobates, and he was ruler of the satrapy of Dascyleium. He and
Oroetes had been talking together, and from talking they fell to
quarrelling and comparing their merits; whereupon Mitrobates said to
Oroetes reproachfully, "Art thou worthy to be called a man, when, near
as Samos lies to thy government, and easy as it is to conquer, thou
hast omitted to bring it under the dominion of the king? Easy to
conquer, said I? Why, a mere common citizen, with the help of
fifteen men-at-arms, mastered the island, and is still king of it."
Oroetes, they say, took this reproach greatly to heart; but, instead
of seeking to revenge himself on the man by whom it was uttered, he
conceived the desire of destroying Polycrates, since it was on
Polycrates' account that the reproach had fallen on him.

Another less common version of the story is that Oroetes sent a
herald to Samos to make a request, the nature of which is not
stated; Polycrates was at the time reclining in the apartment of the
males, and Anacreon the Teian was with him; when therefore the
herald came forward to converse, Polycrates, either out of studied
contempt for the power of Oroetes, or it may be merely by chance,
was lying with his face turned away towards the wall; and so he lay
all the time that the herald spake, and when he ended, did not even
vouchsafe him a word.

Such are the two reasons alleged for the death of Polycrates; it
is open to all to believe which they please. What is certain is that
Oroetes, while residing at Magnesia on the Maeander, sent a Lydian, by
name Myrsus, the son of Gyges, with a message to Polycrates at
Samos, well knowing what that monarch designed. For Polycrates
entertained a design which no other Greek, so far as we know, ever
formed before him, unless it were Minos the Cnossian, and those (if
there were any such) who had the mastery of the Egaean at an earlier
time- Polycrates, I say, was the first of mere human birth who
conceived the design of gaining the empire of the sea, and aspired
to rule over Ionia and the islands. Knowing then that Polycrates was
thus minded, Oroetes sent his message, which ran as follows:-

"Oroetes to Polycrates thus sayeth: I hear thou raisest thy
thoughts high, but thy means are not equal to thy ambition. Listen
then to my words, and learn how thou mayest at once serve thyself
and preserve me. King Cambyses is bent on my destruction- of this I
have warning from a sure hand. Come thou, therefore, and fetch me
away, me and all my wealth- share my wealth with me, and then, so
far as money can aid, thou mayest make thyself master of the whole
of Greece. But if thou doubtest of my wealth, send the trustiest of
thy followers, and I will show my treasures to him."

Polycrates, when he heard this message, was full of joy, and
straightway approved the terms; but, as money was what he chiefly
desired, before stirring in the business he sent his secretary,
Maeandrius, son of Maeandrius, a Samian, to look into the matter. This
was the man who, not very long afterwards, made an offering at the
temple of Juno of all the furniture which had adorned the male
apartments in the palace of Polycrates, an offering well worth seeing.
Oroetes learning that one was coming to view his treasures,
contrived as follows:- he filled eight great chests almost brimful
of stones, and then covering over the stones with gold, corded the
chests, and so held them in readiness. When Maeandrius arrived, he was
shown this as Oroetes' treasure, and having seen it returned to Samos.

On hearing his account, Polycrates, notwithstanding many
warnings given him by the soothsayers, and much dissuasion of his
friends, made ready to go in person. Even the dream which visited
his daughter failed to check him. She had dreamed that she saw her
father hanging high in air, washed by love, and anointed by the sun.
Having therefore thus dreamed, she used every effort to prevent her
father from going; even as he went on board his penteconter crying
after him with words of evil omen. Then Polycrates threatened her
that, if he returned in safety, he would keep her unmarried many
years. She answered, "Oh! that he might perform his threat; far better
for her to remain long unmarried than to be bereft of her father!"

Polycrates, however, making light of all the counsel offered
him, set sail and went to Oroetes. Many friends accompanied him; among
the rest, Democedes, the son of Calliphon, a native of Crotona, who
was a physician, and the best skilled in his art of all men then
living. Polycrates, on his arrival at Magnesia, perished miserably, in
a way unworthy of his rank and of his lofty schemes. For, if we except
the Syracusans, there has never been one of the Greek tyrants who
was to be compared with Polycrates for magnificence. Oroetes, however,
slew him in a mode which is not fit to be described, and then hung his
dead body upon a cross. His Samian followers Oroetes let go free,
bidding them thank him that they were allowed their liberty; the rest,
who were in part slaves, in part free foreigners, he alike treated
as his slaves by conquest. Then was the dream of the daughter of
Polycrates fulfilled; for Polycrates, as he hung upon the cross, and
rain fell on him, was washed by Jupiter; and he was anointed by the
sun, when his own moisture overspread his body. And so the vast good
fortune of Polycrates came at last to the end which Amasis the
Egyptian king had prophesied in days gone by.

It was not long before retribution for the murder of Polycrates
overtook Oroetes. After the death of Cambyses, and during all the time
that the Magus sat upon the throne, Oroetes remained in Sardis, and
brought no help to the Persians, whom the Medes had robbed of the
sovereignty. On the contrary, amid the troubles of this season, he
slew Mitrobates, the satrap of Dascyleium, who had cast the reproach
upon him in the matter of Polycrates; and he slew also Mitrobates's
son, Cranaspes- both men of high repute among the Persians. He was
likewise guilty of many other acts of insolence; among the rest, of
the following:- there was a courier sent to him by Darius whose
message was not to his mind- Oroetes had him waylaid and murdered on
his road back to the king; the man and his horse both disappeared, and
no traces were left of either.

Darius therefore was no sooner settled upon the throne than he
longed to take vengeance upon Oroetes for all his misdoings, and
especially for the murder of Mitrobates and his son. To send an
armed force openly against him, however, he did not think advisable,
as the whole kingdom was still unsettled, and he too was but lately
come to the throne, while Oroetes, as he understood, had a great
power. In truth a thousand Persians attended on him as a bodyguard,
and he held the satrapies of Phrygia, Lydia, and Ionia. Darius
therefore proceeded by artifice. He called together a meeting of all
the chief of the Persians, and thus addressed them:- "Who among you, O
Persians, will undertake to accomplish me a matter by skill without
force or tumult? Force is misplaced where the work wants skilful
management. Who, then, will undertake to bring me Oroetes alive, or
else to kill him? He never did the Persians any good in his life,
and he has wrought us abundant injury. Two of our number, Mitrobates
and his son, he has slain; and when messengers go to recall him,
even though they have their mandate from me, with an insolence which
is not to be endured, he puts them to death. We must kill this man,
therefore, before he does the Persians any greater hurt."

Thus spoke Darius; and straightway thirty of those present came
forward and offered themselves for the work. As they strove
together, Darius interfered, and bade them have recourse to the lot.
Accordingly lots were cast, and the task fell to Bagaeus, son of
Artontes. Then Bagaeus caused many letters to be written on divers
matters, and sealed them all with the king's signet; after which he
took the letters with him, and departed for Sardis. On his arrival
he was shown into the presence of Oroetes, when he uncovered the
letters one by one, and giving them to the king's secretary- every
satrap has with him a king's secretary- commanded him to read their
contents. Herein his design was to try the fidelity of the
bodyguard, and to see if they would be likely to fall away from
Oroetes. When therefore he saw that they showed the letters all due
respect, and even more highly reverenced their contents, he gave the
secretary a paper in which was written, "Persians, king Darius forbids
you to guard Oroetes." The soldiers at these words laid aside their
spears. So Bagaeus, finding that they obeyed this mandate, took
courage, and gave into the secretary's hands the last letter,
wherein it was written, "King Darius commands the Persians who are
in Sardis to kill Oroetes." Then the guards drew their swords and slew
him upon the spot. Thus did retribution for the murder of Polycrates
the Samian overtake Oroetes the Persian.

Soon after the treasures of Oroetes had been conveyed to Sardis it
happened that king Darius, as he leaped from his horse during the
chase, sprained his foot. The sprain was one of no common severity,
for the ankle-bone was forced quite out of the socket. Now Darius
already had at his court certain Egyptians whom he reckoned the
best-skilled physicians in all the world; to their aid, therefore,
he had recourse; but they twisted the foot so clumsily, and used
such violence, that they only made the mischief greater. For seven
days and seven nights the king lay without sleep, so grievous was
the pain he suffered. On the eighth day of his indisposition, one
who had heard before leaving Sardis of the skill of Democedes the
Crotoniat, told Darius, who commanded that he should be brought with
all speed into his presence. When, therefore, they had found him among
the slaves of Oroetes, quite uncared for by any one, they brought
him just as he was, clanking his fetters, and all clothed in rags,
before the king.

As soon as he was entered into the presence, Darius asked him if
he knew medicine- to which he answered "No," for he feared that if
he made himself known he would lose all chance of ever again beholding
Greece. Darius, however, perceiving that he dealt deceitfully, and
really understood the art, bade those who had brought him to the
presence go fetch the scourges and the pricking-irons. Upon this
Democedes made confession, but at the same time said, that he had no
thorough knowledge of medicine- he had but lived some time with a
physician, and in this way had gained a slight smattering of the
art. However, Darius put himself under his care, and Democedes, by
using the remedies customary among the Greeks, and exchanging the
violent treatment of the Egyptians for milder means, first enabled him
to get some sleep, and then in a very little time restored him
altogether, after he had quite lost the hope of ever having the use of
his foot. Hereupon the king presented Democedes with two sets of
fetters wrought in gold; so Democedes asked if he meant to double
his sufferings because he had brought him back to health? Darius was
pleased at the speech, and bade the eunuchs take Democedes to see
his wives, which they did accordingly, telling them all that this
was the man who had saved the king's life. Then each of the wives
dipped with a saucer into a chest of gold, and gave so bountifully
to Democedes, that a slave named Sciton, who followed him, and
picked up the staters which fell from the saucers, gathered together a
great heap of gold.

This Democedes left his country and became attached to
Polycrates in the following way:- His father, who dwelt at Crotona,
was a man of a savage temper, and treated him cruelly. When,
therefore, he could no longer bear such constant ill-usage,
Democedes left his home, and sailed away to Egina. There he set up
in business, and succeeded the first year in surpassing all the
best-skilled physicians of the place, notwithstanding that he was
without instruments, and had with him none of the appliances needful
for the practice of his art. In the second year the state of Egina
hired his services at the price of a talent; in the third the
Athenians engaged him at a hundred minae; and in the fourth Polycrates
at two talents. So he went to Samos, and there took up his abode. It
was in no small measure from his success that the Crotoniats came to
be reckoned such good physicians; for about this period the physicians
of Crotona had the name of being the best, and those of Cyrene the
second best, in all Greece. The Argives, about the same time, were
thought to be the first musicians in Greece.

After Democedes had cured Darius at Susa, he dwelt there in a
large house, and feasted daily at the king's table, nor did he lack
anything that his heart desired, excepting liberty to return to his
country. By interceding for them with Darius, he saved the lives of
the Egyptian physicians who had had the care of the king before he
came, when they were about to be impaled because they had been
surpassed by a Greek; and further, he succeeded in rescuing an Elean
soothsayer, who had followed the fortunes of Polycrates, and was lying
in utter neglect among his slaves. In short there was no one who stood
so high as Democedes in the favour of the king.

Moreover, within a little while it happened that Atossa, the
daughter of Cyrus, who was married to Darius, had a boil form upon her
breast, which, after it burst, began to spread and increase. Now so
long as the sore was of no great size, she hid it through shame and
made no mention of it to any one; but when it became worse, she sent
at last for Democedes, and showed it to him. Democedes said that he
would make her well, but she must first promise him with an oath
that if he cured her she would grant him whatever request he might
prefer; assuring her at the same time that it should be nothing
which she could blush to hear.

On these terms Democedes applied his art, and soon cured the
abscess; and Atossa, when she had heard his request, spake thus one
night to Darius:-

"It seemeth to me strange, my lord, that, with the mighty power
which is thine, thou sittest idle, and neither makest any conquest,
nor advancest the power of the Persians. Methinks that one who is so
young, and so richly endowed with wealth, should perform some noble
achievement to prove to the Persians that it is a man who governs
them. Another reason, too, should urge thee to attempt some
enterprise. Not only does it befit thee to show the Persians that a
man rules them, but for thy own peace thou shouldest waste their
strength in wars lest idleness breed revolt against thy authority.
Now, too, whilst thou art still young, thou mayest well accomplish
some exploit; for as the body grows in strength the mind too ripens,
and as the body ages, the mind's powers decay, till at last it becomes
dulled to everything."

So spake Atossa, as Democedes had instructed her. Darius
answered:- "Dear lady, thou hast uttered the very thoughts that occupy
my brain. I am minded to construct a bridge which shall join our
continent with the other, and so carry war into Scythia. Yet a brief
space and all will be accomplished as thou desirest."

But Atossa rejoined:- "Look now, this war with Scythia were best
reserved awhile- for the Scythians may be conquered at any time.
Prithee, lead me thy host first into Greece. I long to be served by
some of those Lacedaemonian maids of whom I have heard so much. I want
also Argive, and Athenian, and Corinthian women. There is now at the
court a man who can tell thee better than any one else in the whole
world whatever thou wouldst know concerning Greece, and who might
serve thee right well as guide; I mean him who performed the cure on
thy foot."

"Dear lady," Darius answered, "since it is thy wish that we try
first the valour of the Greeks, it were best, methinks, before
marching against them, to send some Persians to spy out the land; they
may go in company with the man thou mentionest, and when they have
seen and learnt all, they can bring us back a full report. Then,
having a more perfect knowledge of them, I will begin the war."

Darius, having so spoke, put no long distance between the word and
the deed, but as soon as day broke he summoned to his presence fifteen
Persians of note, and bade them take Democedes for their guide, and
explore the sea-coasts of Greece. Above all, they were to be sure to
bring Democedes back with them, and not suffer him to run away and
escape. After he had given these orders, Darius sent for Democedes,
and besought him to serve as guide to the Persians, and when he had
shown them the whole of Greece to come back to Persia. He should take,
he said, all the valuables he possessed as presents to his father
and his brothers, and he should receive on his return a far more
abundant store. Moreover, the king added, he would give him, as his
contribution towards the presents, a merchantship laden with all
manner of precious things, which should accompany him on his voyage.
Now I do not believe that Darius, when he made these promises, had any
guile in his heart: Democedes, however, who suspected that the king
spoke to try him, took care not to snatch at the offers with any
haste; but said, "he would leave his own goods behind to enjoy upon
his return- the merchant-ship which the king proposed to grant him
to carry gifts to his brothers, that he would accept at the king's
hands." So when Darius had laid his orders upon Democedes, he sent him
and the Persians away to the coast.

The men went down to Phoenicia, to Sidon, the Phoenician town,
where straightway they fitted out two triremes and a trading-vessel,
which they loaded with all manner of precious merchandise; and,
everything being now ready, they set sail for Greece. When they had
made the land, they kept along the shore and examined it, taking notes
of all that they saw; and in this way they explored the greater
portion of the country, and all the most famous regions, until at last
they reached Tarentum in Italy. There Aristophilides, king of the
Tarentines, out of kindness to Democedes, took the rudders off the
Median ships, and detained their crews as spies. Meanwhile Democedes
escaped to Crotona, his native city, whereupon Aristophilides released
the Persians from prison, and gave their rudders back to them.

The Persians now quitted Tarentum, and sailed to Crotona in
pursuit of Democedes; they found him in the market-place, where they
straightway laid violent hands on him. Some of the Crotoniats, who
greatly feared the power of the Persians, were willing to give him up;
but others resisted, held Democedes fast, and even struck the Persians
with their walking-sticks. They, on their part, kept crying out,
"Men of Crotona, beware what you do. It is the king's runaway slave
that you are rescuing. Think you Darius will tamely submit to such
an insult? Think you, that if you carry off the man from us, it will
hereafter go well with you? Will you not rather be the first persons
on whom we shall make war? Will not your city be the first we shall
seek to lead away captive?" Thus they spake, but the Crotoniats did
not heed them; they rescued Democedes, and seized also the
trading-ship which the Persians had brought with them from
Phoenicia. Thus robbed, and bereft of their guide, the Persians gave
up all hope of exploring the rest of Greece, and set sail for Asia. As
they were departing, Democedes sent to them and begged they would
inform Darius that the daughter of Milo was allianced to him as his
bride. For the name of Milo the wrestler was in high repute with the
king. My belief is, that Democedes hastened his marriage by the
payment of a large sum of money for the purpose of showing Darius that
he was a man of mark in his own country.

The Persians weighed anchor and left Crotona, but, being wrecked
on the coast of Iapygia, were made slaves by the inhabitants. From
this condition they were rescued by Gillus, a banished Tarentine,
who ransomed them at his own cost, and took them back to Darius.
Darius offered to repay this service by granting Gillus whatever
boon he chose to ask; whereupon Gillus told the king of his
misfortune, and begged to be restored to his country. Fearing,
however, that he might bring trouble on Greece if a vast armament were
sent to Italy on his account, he added that it would content him if
the Cnidians undertook to obtain his recall. Now the Cnidians were
dose friends of the Tarentines, which made him think there was no
likelier means of procuring his return. Darius promised and
performed his part; for he sent messenger to Cnidus, and commanded the
Cnidians to restore Gillus. The Cnidians did as he wished, but found
themselves unable to persuade the Tarentines, and were too weak to
attempt force. Such then was the course which this matter took.
These were the first Persians who ever came from Asia to Greece; and
they were sent to spy out the land for the reason which I have
before mentioned.

After this, king Darius besieged and took Samos, which was the
first city, Greek or Barbarian, that he conquered. The cause of his
making war upon Samos was the following:- at the time when Cambyses,
son of Cyrus, marched against Egypt, vast numbers of Greeks flocked
thither; some, as might have been looked for, to push their trade;
others, to serve in his army; others again, merely to see the land:
among these last was Syloson, son of Aeaces, and brother of
Polycrates, at that time an exile from Samos. This Syloson, during his
stay in Egypt, met with a singular piece of good fortune. He
happened one day to put on a scarlet cloak, and thus attired to go
into the market-place at Memphis, when Dariuss who was one of
Cambyses' bodyguard, and not at that time a man of any account, saw
him, and taking a strong liking to the dress, went up and offered to
purchase it. Syloson perceived how anxious he was, and by a lucky
inspiration answered: "There is no price at which I would sell my
cloak; but I will give it thee for nothing, if it must needs be
thine." Darius thanked him, and accepted the garment.

Poor Syloson felt at the time that he had fooled away his cloak in
a very simple manner; but afterwards, when in the course of years
Cambyses died, and the seven Persians rose in revolt against the
Magus, and Darius was the man chosen out of the seven to have the
kingdom, Syloson learnt that the person to whom the crown had come was
the very man who had coveted his cloak in Egypt, and to whom he had
freely given it. So he made his way to Susa, and seating himself at
the portal of the royal palace, gave out that he was a benefactor of
the king. Then the doorkeeper went and told Darius. Amazed at what
he heard, king said thus within himself:- "What Greek can have been my
benefactor, or to which of them do I owe anything, so lately as I have
got the kingdom? Scarcely a man of them all has been here, not more
than one or two certainly, since I came to the throne. Nor do I
remember that I am in the debt of any Greek. However, bring him in,
and let me hear what he means by his boast." So the doorkeeper ushered
Syloson into the presence, and the interpreters asked him who he
was, and what he had done that he should call himself a benefactor
of the king. Then Syloson told the whole story of the cloak, and
said that it was he who had made Darius the present. Hereupon Darius
exclaimed, "Oh! thou most generous of men, art thou indeed he who,
when I had no power at all, gavest me something, albeit little?
Truly the favour is as great as a very grand present would be
nowadays. I will therefore give thee in return gold and silver without
stint, that thou mayest never repent of having rendered a service to
Darius, son of Hystaspes. "Give me not, O king," replied Syloson,
"either silver or gold, but recover me Samos, my native land, and
let that be thy gift to me. It belongs now to a slave of ours, who,
when Oroetes put my brother Polycrates to death, became its master.
Give me Samos, I beg; but give it unharmed, with no bloodshed- no
leading into captivity."

When he heard this, Darius sent off an army, under Otanes, one
of the seven, with orders to accomplish all that Syloson had
desired. And Otanes went down to the coast and made ready to cross
over.

The government of Samos was held at this time by Maeandrius, son
of Maeandrius, whom Polycrates had appointed as his deputy. This
person conceived the wish to act like the justest of men, but it was
not allowed him to do so. On receiving tidings of the death of
Polycrates, he forthwith raised an altar to love the Protector of
Freedom, and assigned it the piece of ground which may still be seen
in the suburb. This done, he assembled all the citizens, and spoke
to them as follows:-

"Ye know, friends, that the sceptre of Polycrates, and all his
power, has passed into my hands, and if I choose I may rule over
you. But what I condemn in another I will, if I may, avoid myself. I
never approved the ambition of Polycrates to lord it over men as
good as himself, nor looked with favour on any of those who have
done the like. Now therefore, since he has fulfilled his destiny, I
lay down my office, and proclaim equal rights. All that I claim in
return is six talents from the treasures of Polycrates, and the
priesthood of Jove the Protector of Freedom, for myself and my
descendants for ever. Allow me this, as the man by whom his temple has
been built, and by whom ye yourselves are now restored to liberty." As
soon as Maeandrius had ended, one of the Samians rose up and said, "As
if thou wert fit to rule us, base-born and rascal as thou art! Think
rather of accounting for the monies which thou hast fingered."

The man who thus spoke was a certain Telesarchus, one of the
leading citizens. Maeandrius, therefore, feeling sure that if he
laid down the sovereign power some one else would become tyrant in his
room, gave up the thought of relinquishing it. Withdrawing to the
citadel, he sent for the chief men one by one, under pretence of
showing them his accounts, and as fast as they came arrested them
and put them in irons. So these men were bound; and Maeandrius
within a short time fell sick: whereupon Lycaretus, one of his
brothers, thinking that he was going to die, and wishing to make his
own accession to the throne the easier, slew all the prisoners. It
seemed that the Samians did not choose to be a free people.

When the Persians whose business it was to restore Syloson reached
Samos, not a man was found to lift up his hand against them.
Maeandrius and his partisans expressed themselves willing to quit
the island upon certain terms, and these terms were agreed to by
Otanes. After the treaty was made, the most distinguished of the
Persians had their thrones brought, and seated themselves over against
the citadel.

Now the king Maeandrius had a lightheaded brother- Charilaus by
name- whom for some offence or other he had shut up in prison: this
man heard what was going on, and peering through his bars, saw the
Persians sitting peacefully upon their seats, whereupon he exclaimed
aloud, and said he must speak with Maeandrius. When this was
reported to him, Maeandrius gave orders that Charilaus should be
released from prison and brought into his presence. No sooner did he
arrive than he began reviling and abusing his brother, and strove to
persuade him to attack the Persians. "Thou meanest-spirited of men,"
he said, "thou canst keep me, thy brother, chained in a dungeon,
notwithstanding that I have done nothing worthy of bonds; but when the
Persians come and drive thee forth a houseless wanderer from thy
native land, thou lookest on, and hast not the heart to seek
revenge, though they might so easily be subdued. If thou, however, art
afraid, lend me thy soldiers, and I will make them pay dearly for
their coming here. I engage too to send thee first safe out of the
island."

So spake Charilaus, and Maeandrius gave consent; not (I believe)
that he was so void of sense as to imagine that his own forces could
overcome those of the king, but because he was jealous of Syloson, and
did not wish him to get so quietly an unharmed city. He desired
therefore to rouse the anger of the Persians against Samos, that so he
might deliver it up to Syloson with its power at the lowest possible
ebb; for he knew well that if the Persians met with a disaster they
would be furious against the Samians, while he himself felt secure
of a retreat at any time that he liked, since he had a secret
passage under ground leading from the citadel to the sea. Maeandrius
accordingly took ship and sailed away from Samos; and Charilaus,
having armed all the mercenaries, threw open the gates, and fell
upon the Persians, who looked for nothing less, since they supposed
that the whole matter had been arranged by treaty. At the first
onslaught therefore all the Persians of most note, men who were in the
habit of using litters, were slain by the mercenaries; the rest of the
army, however, came to the rescue, defeated the mercenaries, and drove
them back into the citadel.

Then Otanes, the general, when he saw the great calamity which had
befallen the Persians, made up his mind to forget the orders which
Darius had given him, "not to kill or enslave a single Samian, but
to deliver up the island unharmed to Syloson," and gave the word to
his army that they should slay the Samians, both men and boys,
wherever they could find them. Upon this some of his troops laid siege
to the citadel, while others began the massacre, killing all they met,
some outside, some inside the temples.

Maeandrius fled from Samos to Lacedaemon, and conveyed thither all
the riches which he had brought away from the island, after which he
acted as follows. Having placed upon his board all the gold and silver
vessels that he had, and bade his servants employ themselves in
cleaning them, he himself went and entered into conversation with
Cleomenes, son of Anaxandridas, king of Sparta, and as they talked
brought him along to his house. There Cleomenes, seeing the plate, was
filled with wonder and astonishment; whereon the other begged that
he would carry home with him any of the vessels that he liked.
Maeandrius said this two or three times; but Cleomenes here
displayed surpassing honesty. He refused the gift, and thinking that
if Maeandrius made the same offers to others he would get the aid he
sought, the Spartan king went straight to the ephors and told them "it
would be best for Sparta that the Samian stranger should be sent
away from the Peloponnese; for otherwise he might perchance persuade
himself or some other Spartan to be base." The ephors took his advice,
and let Maeandrius know by a herald that he must leave the city.

Meanwhile the Persians netted Samos, and delivered it up to
Syloson, stripped of all its men. After some time, however, this
same general Otanes was induced to repeople it by a dream which he
had, and a loathsome disease that seized on him.

After the armament of Otanes had set sail for Samos, the
Babylonians revolted, having made every preparation for defence.
During all the time that the Magus was king, and while the seven
were conspiring, they had profited by the troubles, and had made
themselves ready against a siege. And it happened somehow or other
that no one perceived what they were doing. At last when the time came
for rebelling openly, they did as follows:- having first set apart
their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one
woman, whomsoever he pleased; these alone were allowed to live,
while all the rest were brought to one place and strangled. The
women chosen were kept to make bread for the men; while the others
were strangled that they might not consume the stores.

When tidings reached Darius of what had happened, he drew together
all his power, and began the war by marching straight upon Babylon,
and laying siege to the place. The Babylonians, however, cared not a
whit for his siege. Mounting upon the battlements that crowned their
walls, they insulted and jeered at Darius and his mighty host. One
even shouted to them and said, "Why sit ye there, Persians? why do
ye not go back to your homes? Till mules foal ye will not take our
city." This was by a Babylonian who thought that a mule would never
foal.

Now when a year and seven months had passed, Darius and his army
were quite wearied out, finding that they could not anyhow take the
city. All stratagems and all arts had been used, and yet the king
could not prevail- not even when he tried the means by which Cyrus
made himself master of the place. The Babylonians were ever upon the
watch, and he found no way of conquering them.

At last, in the twentieth month, a marvellous thing happened to
Zopyrus, son of the Megabyzus who was among the seven men that
overthrew the Magus. One of his sumpter-mules gave birth to a foal.
Zopyrus, when they told him, not thinking that it could be true,
went and saw the colt with his own eyes; after which he commanded
his servants to tell no one what had come to pass, while he himself
pondered the matter. Calling to mind then the words of the
Babylonian at the beginning of the siege, "Till mules foal ye shall
not take our city"- he thought, as he reflected on this speech, that
Babylon might now be taken. For it seemed to him that there was a
Divine Providence in the man having used the phrase, and then his mule
having foaled.

As soon therefore as he felt within himself that Babylon was fated
to be taken, he went to Darius and asked him if he set a very high
value on its conquest. When he found that Darius did indeed value it
highly, he considered further with himself how he might make the
deed his own, and be the man to take Babylon. Noble exploits in Persia
are ever highly honoured and bring their authors to greatness. He
therefore reviewed all ways of bringing the city under, but found none
by which he could hope to prevail, unless he maimed himself and then
went over to the enemy. To do this seeming to him a light matter, he
mutilated himself in a way that was utterly without remedy. For he cut
off his own nose and ears, and then, clipping his hair close and
flogging himself with a scourge, he came in this plight before Darius.

Wrath stirred within the king at the sight of a man of his lofty
rank in such a condition; leaping down from his throne, he exclaimed
aloud, and asked Zopyrus who it was that had disfigured him, and
what he had done to be so treated. Zopyrus answered, "There is not a
man in the world, but thou, O king, that could reduce me to such a
plight- no stranger's hands have wrought this work on me, but my own
only. I maimed myself I could not endure that the Assyrians should
laugh at the Persians." "Wretched man," said Darius, "thou coverest
the foulest deed with the fairest possible name, when thou sayest
thy maiming is to help our siege forward. How will thy
disfigurement, thou simpleton, induce the enemy to yield one day the
sooner? Surely thou hadst gone out of thy mind when thou didst so
misuse thyself." "Had I told thee," rejoined the other, "what I was
bent on doing, thou wouldest not have suffered it; as it is, I kept my
own counsel, and so accomplished my plans. Now, therefore, if there be
no failure on thy part, we shall take Babylon. I will desert to the
enemy as I am, and when I get into their city I will tell them that it
is by thee I have been thus treated. I think they will believe my
words, and entrust me with a command of troops. Thou, on thy part,
must wait till the tenth day after I am entered within the town, and
then place near to the gates of Semiramis a detachment of thy army,
troops for whose loss thou wilt care little, a thousand men. Wait,
after that, seven days, and post me another detachment, two thousand
strong, at the Nineveh gates; then let twenty days pass, and at the
end of that time station near the Chaldaean gates a body of four
thousand. Let neither these nor the former troops be armed with any
weapons but their swords- those thou mayest leave them. After the
twenty days are over, bid thy whole army attack the city on every
side, and put me two bodies of Persians, one at the Belian, the
other at the Cissian gates; for I expect, that, on account of my
successes, the Babylonians will entrust everything, even the keys of
their gates, to me. Then it will be for me and my Persians to do the
rest."

Having left these instructions, Zopyrus fled towards the gates
of the town, often looking back, to give himself the air of a
deserter. The men upon the towers, whose business it was to keep a
lookout, observing him, hastened down, and setting one of the gates
slightly ajar, questioned him who he was, and on what errand he had
come. He replied that he was Zopyrus, and had deserted to them from
the Persians. Then the doorkeepers, when they heard this, carried
him at once before the Magistrates. Introduced into the assembly, he
began to bewail his misfortunes, telling them that Darius had
maltreated him in the way they could see, only because he had given
advice that the siege should be raised, since there seemed no hope
of taking the city. "And now," he went on to say, "my coming to you,
Babylonians, will prove the greatest gain that you could possibly
receive, while to Darius and the Persians it will be the severest
loss. Verily he by whom I have been so mutilated shall not escape
unpunished. And truly all the paths of his counsels are known to
me." Thus did Zopyrus speak.

The Babylonians, seeing a Persian of such exalted rank in so
grievous a plight, his nose and ears cut off, his body red with
marks of scourging and with blood, had no suspicion but that he
spoke the truth, and was really come to be their friend and helper.
They were ready, therefore, to grant him anything that he asked; and
on his suing for a command, they entrusted to him a body of troops,
with the help of which he proceeded to do as he had arranged with
Darius. On the tenth day after his flight he led out his detachment,
and surrounding the thousand men, whom Darius according to agreement
had sent first, he fell upon them and slew them all. Then the
Babylonians, seeing that his deeds were as brave as his words, were
beyond measure pleased, and set no bounds to their trust. He waited,
however, and when the next period agreed on had elapsed, again with
a band of picked men he sallied forth, and slaughtered the two
thousand. After this second exploit, his praise was in all mouths.
Once more, however, he waited till the interval appointed had gone by,
and then leading the troops to the place where the four thousand were,
he put them also to the sword. This last victory gave the finishing
stroke to his power, and made him all in all with the Babylonians:
accordingly they committed to him the command of their whole army, and
put the keys of their city into his hands.

Darius now, still keeping to the plan agreed upon, attacked the
walls on every side, whereupon Zopyrus played out the remainder of his
stratagem. While the Babylonians, crowding to the walls, did their
best to resist the Persian assault, he threw open the Cissian and
the Belian gates, and admitted the enemy. Such of the Babylonians as
witnessed the treachery, took refuge in the temple of Jupiter Belus;
the rest, who did not see it, kept at their posts, till at last they
too learnt that they were betrayed.

Thus was Babylon taken for the second time. Darius having become
master of the place, destroyed the wall, and tore down all the
gates; for Cyrus had done neither the one nor the other when he took
Babylon. He then chose out near three thousand of the leading
citizens, and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the
remainder still to inhabit the city. Further, wishing to prevent the
race of the Babylonians from becoming extinct, he provided wives for
them in the room of those whom (as I explained before) they strangled,
to save their stores. These he levied from the nations bordering on
Babylonia, who were each required to send so large a number to
Babylon, that in all there were collected no fewer than fifty
thousand. It is from these women that the Babylonians of our times are
sprung.

As for Zopyrus, he was considered by Darius to have surpassed,
in the greatness of his achievements, all other Persians, whether of
former or of later times, except only Cyrus- with whom no Persian ever
yet thought himself worthy to compare. Darius, as the story goes,
would often say that "he had rather Zopyrus were unmaimed, than be
master of twenty more Babylons." And he honoured Zopyrus greatly; year
by year he presented him with all the gifts which are held in most
esteem among the Persians; he gave him likewise the government of
Babylon for his life, free from tribute; and he also granted him
many other favours. Megabyzus, who held the command in Egypt against
the Athenians and their allies, was a son of this Zopyrus. And
Zopyrus, who fled from Persia to Athens, was a son of this Megabyzus.
