        <h1>IX CALLIOPE</h1>

        <p id="passage-1"><a href="#passage-1" class="passage-id">1</a> Mardonius, when Alexander upon his return made known to him the
answer of the Athenians, forthwith broke up from Thessaly, and led his
army with all speed against Athens; forcing the several nations
through whose land he passed to furnish him with additional troops.
The chief men of Thessaly, far from repenting of the part which they
had taken in the war hitherto, urged on the Persians to the attack
more earnestly than ever. Thorax of Larissa in particular, who had
helped to escort Xerxes on his flight to Asia, now openly encouraged
Mardonius in his march upon Greece.</p>
<p id="passage-2"><a href="#passage-2" class="passage-id">2</a> When the army reached Boeotia, the Thebans sought to induce
Mardonius to make a halt: "He would not," they told him, "find
anywhere a more convenient place in which to pitch his camp; and their
advice to him was, that he should go no further, but fix himself
there, and thence take measures to subdue all Greece without
striking a blow. If the Greeks, who had held together hitherto,
still continued united among themselves, it would be difficult for the
whole world to overcome them by force of arms. But if thou wilt do
as we advise," they went on to say, "thou mayest easily obtain the
direction of all their counsels. Send presents to the men of most
weight in the several states, and by so doing thou wilt sow division
among them. After that, it will be a light task, with the help of such
as side with thee, to bring under all thy adversaries."</p>
<p id="passage-3"><a href="#passage-3" class="passage-id">3</a> Such was the advice of the Thebans: but Mardonius did not follow
it. A strong desire of taking Athens a second time possessed him, in
part arising from his inborn stubbornness, in part from a wish to
inform the king at Sardis, by fire-signals along the islands, that
he was master of the place. However, he did not on his arrival in
Attica find the Athenians in their country- they had again
withdrawn, some to their ships, but the greater part to Salamis- and
he only gained possession of a deserted town. It was ten months
after the taking of the city by the king that Mardonius came against
it for the second time.</p>
<p id="passage-4"><a href="#passage-4" class="passage-id">4</a> Mardonius, being now in Athens, sent an envoy to Salamis, one
Murychides, a Hellespontine Greek, to offer the Athenians once more
the same terms which had been conveyed to them by Alexander. The
reason for his sending a second time, though he knew beforehand
their unfriendly feelings towards him, was,- that he hoped, when
they saw the whole land of Attica conquered and in his power, their
stubbornness would begin to give way. On this account, therefore, he
dispatched Murychides to Salamis.</p>
<p id="passage-5"><a href="#passage-5" class="passage-id">5</a> Now, when Murychides came before the council, and delivered his
message, one of the councillors, named Lycidas, gave it as his
opinion- "that the best course would be, to admit the proposals
brought by Murychides, and lay them before the assembly of the
people." This he stated to be his opinion, perhaps because he had been
bribed by Mardonius, or it may be because that course really
appeared to him the most expedient. However, the Athenians- both those
in the council, and those who stood without, when they heard of the
advice- were full of wrath, and forthwith surrounded Lycidas, and
stoned him to death. As for Murychides, the Hellespontine Greek, him
they sent away unharmed. Now there was a stir in the island about
Lycidas, and the Athenian women learnt what had happened. Then each
exhorted her fellow, and one brought another to take part in the deed;
and they all flocked of their own accord to the house of Lycidas,
and stoned to death his wife and his children.</p>
<p id="passage-6"><a href="#passage-6" class="passage-id">6</a> The circumstances under which the Athenians had sought refuge in
Salamis were the following. So long as any hope remained that a
Peloponnesian army would come to give them aid, they abode still in
Attica; but when it appeared that the allies were slack and slow to
move, while the invader was reported to be pressing forward and to
have already entered Boeotia, then they proceeded to remove their
goods and chattels from the mainland, and themselves again crossed the
strait to Salamis. At the same time they sent ambassadors to
Lacedaemon, who were to reproach the Lacedaemonians for having allowed
the barbarian to advance into Attica, instead of joining them and
going out to meet him in Boeotia. They were likewise to remind the
Lacedaemonians of the offers by which the Persian had sought to win
Athens over to his side, and to warn them, that no aid came from
Sparta, the Athenians must consult for their own safety.</p>
<p id="passage-7"><a href="#passage-7" class="passage-id">7</a> The truth was, the Lacedaemonians were keeping holiday at that
time; for it was the feast of the Hyacinthia, and they thought nothing
of so much moment as to perform the service of the god. They were also
engaged in building their wall across the Isthmus, which was now so
far advanced that the battlements had begun to be placed upon it.</p>
<p id="passage-8"><a href="#passage-8" class="passage-id">8</a> When the envoys of the Athenians, accompanied by ambassadors
from Megara and Plataea, reached Lacedaemon, they came before the
Ephors, and spoke as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-9"><a href="#passage-9" class="passage-id">9</a> "The Athenians have sent us to you to say,- the king of the
Medes offers to give us back our country, and wishes to conclude an
alliance with us on fair and equal terms, without fraud or deceit.
He is willing likewise to bestow on us another country besides our
own, and bids us choose any land that we like. But we, because we
reverenced Hellenic Jupiter, and thought it a shameful act to betray
Greece, instead of consenting to these terms, refused them;
notwithstanding that we have been wronged and deserted by the other
Greeks, and are fully aware that it is far more for our advantage to
make peace with the Persian than to prolong the war with him. Still we
shall not, of our own free will, consent to any terms of peace. Thus
do we, in all our dealings with the Greeks, avoid what is base and
counterfeit: while contrariwise, ye, who were but now so full of
fear least we should make terms with the enemy, having learnt of
what temper we are, and assured yourselves that we shall not prove
traitors to our country- having brought moreover your wall across
the Isthmus to an advanced state- cease altogether to have any care
for us. Ye covenanted with us to go out and meet the Persian in
Boeotia; but when the time came, ye were false to your word, and
looked on while the barbarian host advanced into Attica. At this time,
therefore, the Athenians are angered with you; and justly,- for ye
have not done what was right. They bid you, however, make haste to
send forth your army, that we may even yet meet Mardonius in Attica.
Now that Boeotia is lost to us, the best place for the fight within
our country, will be the plain of Thria."</p>
<p id="passage-10"><a href="#passage-10" class="passage-id">10</a> The Ephors, when they had heard this speech, delayed their
answer till the morrow; and when the morrow came, till the day
following. And thus they acted for ten days, continually putting off
the ambassadors from one day to the next. Meanwhile the Peloponnesians
generally were labouring with great zeal at the wall, and the work
nearly approached completion. I can give no other reason for the
conduct of the Lacedaemonians in showing themselves so anxious, at the
time when Alexander came, that the Athenians should not join the
Medes, and now being quite careless about it, except that at the
former time the wall across the Isthmus was not complete, and they
worked at it in great fear of the Persians, whereas now the bulwark
had been raised, and so they imagined that they had no further need of
the Athenians.</p>
<p id="passage-11"><a href="#passage-11" class="passage-id">11</a> At last the ambassadors got an answer, and the troops marched
forth from Sparta, under the following circumstances. The last
audience had been fixed for the ambassadors, when, the very day before
it was to be given, a certain Tegean, named Chileus, a man who had
more influence at Sparta than any other foreigner, learning from the
Ephors exactly what the Athenians had said, addressed these words to
them- "The case stands thus, O ye Ephors! If the Athenians are not our
friends, but league themselves with the barbarians, however strong our
wall across the Isthmus may be, there will be doors enough, and wide
enough open too, by which the Persian may gain entrance to the
Peloponnese. Grant their request then, before they make any fresh
resolve, which may bring Greece to ruin."</p>
<p id="passage-12"><a href="#passage-12" class="passage-id">12</a> Such was the counsel which Chileus gave: and the Ephors, taking
the advice into consideration, determined forthwith, without
speaking a word to the ambassadors from the three cities, to
despatch to the Isthmus a body of five thousand Spartans; and
accordingly they sent them forth the same night, appointing to each
Spartan a retinue of seven Helots, and giving the command of the
expedition to Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus. The chief power
belonged of right at this time to Pleistarchus, the son of Leonidas;
but as he was still a child Pausanias, his cousin, was regent in his
room. For the father of Pausanias, Cleombrotus, the son of
Anaxandridas, no longer lived; he had died a short time after bringing
back from the Isthmus the troops who had been employed in building the
wall. A prodigy had caused him to bring his army home; for while he
was offering sacrifice to know if he should march out against the
Persian, the sun was suddenly darkened in mid sky. Pausanias took with
him, as joint-leader of the army, Euryanax, the son of Dorieus, a
member of his own family.</p>
<p id="passage-13"><a href="#passage-13" class="passage-id">13</a> The army accordingly had marched out from Sparta with Pausanias:
while the ambassadors, when day came, appeared before the Ephors,
knowing nothing of the march of the troops, and purposing themselves
to leave Sparta forthwith, and return each man to his own country.
They therefore addressed the Ephors in these words:-
"Lacedaemonians, as you do not stir from home, but keep the
Hyacinthian festival, and amuse yourselves, deserting the cause of
your confederates, the Athenians, whom your behaviour wrongs, and
who have no other allies, will make such terms with the Persians as
they shall find possible. Now when terms are once made, it is plain
that, having become the king's allies, we shall march with the
barbarians whithersoever they choose to lead. Then at length you
will perceive what the consequences will be to yourselves." When the
envoys had spoken, the Ephors declared to them with an oath:- "Our
troops must be at Oresteum by this time, on their march against the
strangers." (The Spartans say "strangers" for "barbarians.") At this
the ambassadors, quite ignorant of what had happened, questioned
them concerning their meaning; and when, by much questioning, they had
discovered the truth, they were greatly astonished thereat, and
forthwith set off, at their best speed, to overtake the Spartan
army. At the same time a body of five thousand Lacedaemonian Perioeci,
all picked men and fully armed, set forth from Sparta, in the
company of the ambassadors.</p>
<p id="passage-14"><a href="#passage-14" class="passage-id">14</a> So these troops marched in haste towards the Isthmus. Meanwhile
the Argives, who had promised Mardonius that they would stop the
Spartans from crossing their borders, as soon as they learnt that
Pausanias with his army had started from Sparta, took the swiftest
courier they could find, and sent him off to Attica. The message which
he delivered, on his arrival at Athens, was the following:
"Mardonius," he said, "the Argives have sent me to tell thee that
the Lacedaemonian youth are gone forth from their city, and that the
Argives are too weak to hinder them. Take good heed therefore to
thyself at this time." After thus speaking, without a word more, he
returned home.</p>
<p id="passage-15"><a href="#passage-15" class="passage-id">15</a> When Mardonius learnt that the Spartans were on their march, he no
longer cared to remain in Attica. Hitherto he had kept quiet,
wishing to see what the Athenians would do, and had neither ravaged
their territory, nor done it any the least harm; for till now he had
cherished the hope that the Athenians would come to terms with him.
As, however, he found that his persuasions were of no avail, and as
their whole policy was now clear to him, he determined to withdraw
from Attica before Pausanias with his army reached the Isthmus; first,
however, he resolved to burn Athens, and to cast down and level with
the ground whatever remained standing of the walls, temples, and other
buildings. His reason for retreating was, that Attica was not a
country where horse could act with advantage; and further, that if
he suffered defeat in a battle, no way of escape was open to him,
except through defiles, where a handful of troops might stop all his
army. So he determined to withdraw to Thebes, and give the Greeks
battle in the neighbourhood of a friendly city, and on ground well
suited for cavalry.</p>
<p id="passage-16"><a href="#passage-16" class="passage-id">16</a> After he had quitted Attica and was already upon his march, news
reached him that a body of a thousand Lacedaemonians, distinct from
the army of Pausanias, and sent on in advance, had arrived in the
Megarid. When he heard it, wishing, if possible, to destroy this
detachment first, Mardonius considered with himself how he might
compass their ruin. With a sudden change of march he made for
Megara, while the horse, pushing on in advance, entered and ravaged
the Megarid. (Here was the furthest point in Europe towards the
setting sun to which this Persian army ever penetrated.)</p>
<p id="passage-17"><a href="#passage-17" class="passage-id">17</a> After this, Mardonius received another message, whereby he
learnt that the forces of the Greeks were collected together at the
Isthmus; which tidings caused him to draw back, and leave Attica by
the way of Deceleia. The Boeotarchs had sent for some of the
neighbours of the Asopians; and these persons served as guides to
the army, and led them first to Sphendale, and from thence to Tanagra,
where Mardonius rested a night; after which, upon the morrow, he
bent his course to Scolus, which brought him into the territory of the
Thebans. And now, although the Thebans had espoused the cause of the
Medes, yet Mardonius cut down all the trees in these parts; not
however from any enmity towards the Thebans, but on account of his own
urgent needs; for he wanted a rampart to protect his army from attack,
and he likewise desired to have a place of refuge, whither his
troops might flee, in case the battle should go contrary to his
wishes. His army at this time lay on the Asopus, and stretched from
Erythrae, along by Hysiae, to the territory of the Plataeans. The
wall, however, was not made to extend so far, but formed a square of
about ten furlongs each way.</p>
<p id="passage-18"><a href="#passage-18" class="passage-id">18</a> While the barbarians were employed in this work, a certain citizen
of Thebes, Attaginus by name, the son of Phrynon, having made great
preparations, gave a banquet, and invited Mardonius thereto,
together with fifty of the noblest Persians. Now the banquet was
held at Thebes; and all the guests who were invited came to it.</p>
<p id="passage-19"><a href="#passage-19" class="passage-id">19</a> What follows was recounted to me by Thersander, a native of
Orchomenus, a man of the first rank in that city. Thersander told me
that he was himself among those invited to the feast, and that besides
the Persians fifty Thebans were asked; and the two nations were not
arranged separately, but a Persian and a Theban were set side by
side upon each couch. After the feast was ended, and the drinking
had begun, the Persian who shared Thersander's couch addressed him
in the Greek tongue, and inquired of him from what city he came. He
answered, that he was of Orchomenus; whereupon the other said-</p>
<p id="passage-20"><a href="#passage-20" class="passage-id">20</a> "Since thou hast eaten with me at one table, and poured libation
from one cup, I would fain leave with thee a memorial of the belief
I hold- the rather that thou mayest have timely warning thyself, and
so be able to provide for thy own safety. Seest thou these Persians
here feasting, and the army which we left encamped yonder by the
river-side? Yet a little while, and of all this number thou wilt
behold but a few surviving!"</p>
<p id="passage-21"><a href="#passage-21" class="passage-id">21</a> As he spake, the Persian let fall a flood of tears: whereon
Thersander, who was astonished at his words, replied- "Surely thou
shouldest say all this to Mardonius, and the Persians who are next him
in honour"- but the other rejoined- "Dear friend, it is not possible
for man to avert that which God has decreed shall happen. No one
believes warnings, however true. Many of us Persians know our
danger, but we are constrained by necessity to do as our leader bids
us. Verily 'tis the sorest of all human ills, to abound in knowledge
and yet have no power over action." All this I heard myself from
Thersander the Orchomenian; who told me further, that he mentioned
what had happened to divers persons, before the battle was fought at
Plataea.</p>
<p id="passage-22"><a href="#passage-22" class="passage-id">22</a> When Mardonius formerly held his camp in Boeotia, all the Greeks
of those parts who were friendly to the Medes sent troops to join
his army, and these troops accompanied him in his attack upon
Athens. The Phocians alone abstained, and took no part in the
invasion; for, though they had espoused the Median cause warmly, it
was very much against their will, and only because they were compelled
so to do. However, a few days after the arrival of the Persian army at
Thebes, a thousand of their heavy-armed soldiers came up, under the
command of Harmocydes, one of their most distinguished citizens. No
sooner had these troops reached Thebes, than some horsemen came to
them from Mardonius, with orders that they should take up a position
upon the plain, away from the rest of the army. The Phocians did so,
and forthwith the entire Persian cavalry drew nigh to them:
whereupon there went a rumour through the whole of the Greek force
encamped with the Medes, that Mardonius was about to destroy the
Phocians with missiles. The same conviction ran through the Phocian
troops themselves; and Harmocydes, their leader, addressed them thus
with words of encouragement- "Phocians" said he, "'tis plain that
these men have resolved beforehand to take our lives, because of the
accusations of the Thessalians, as I imagine. Now, then, is the time
for you all to show yourselves brave men. 'Tis better to die
fighting and defending our lives, than tamely to allow them to slay us
in this shameful fashion. Let them learn that they are barbarians, and
that the men whose death they have plotted are Greeks!"</p>
<p id="passage-23"><a href="#passage-23" class="passage-id">23</a> Thus spake Harmocydes; and the Persian horse, having encircled the
Phocians, charged towards them, as if about to deal out death, with
bows bent, and arrows ready to be let fly; nay, here and there some
did even discharge their weapons. But the Phocians stood firm, keeping
close one to another, and serrying their ranks as much as possible:
whereupon the horse suddenly wheeled round and rode off. I cannot
say with certainty whether they came, at the prayer of the
Thessalians, to destroy the Phocians, but seeing them prepared to
stand on their defence, and fearing to suffer damage at their hands,
on that account beat a retreat, having orders from Mardonius so to
act; or whether his sole intent was to try the temper of the
Phocians and see whether they had any courage or no. However this
may have been, when the horsemen retired, Mardonius sent a herald to
the Phocians, saying- "Fear not, Phocians- ye have shown yourselves
valiant men- much unlike the report I had heard of you. Now
therefore be forward in the coming war. Ye will not readily outdo
either the king or myself in services." Thus ended the affair of the
Phocians.</p>
<p id="passage-24"><a href="#passage-24" class="passage-id">24</a> The Lacedaemonians, when they reached the Isthmus, pitched their
camp there; and the other Peloponnesians who had embraced the good
side, hearing or else seeing that they were upon the march, thought it
not right to remain behind when the Spartans were going forth to the
war. So the Peloponnesians went out in one body from the Isthmus,
the victims being favourable for setting forth; and marched as far
as Eleusis, where again they offered sacrifices, and, finding the
omens still encouraging, advanced further. At Eleusis they were joined
by the Athenians, who had come across from Salamis, and now
accompanied the main army. On reaching Erythrae in Boeotia, they
learnt that the barbarians were encamped upon the Asopus; wherefore
they themselves, after considering how they should act, disposed their
forces opposite to the enemy upon the slopes of Mount Cithaeron.</p>
<p id="passage-25"><a href="#passage-25" class="passage-id">25</a> Mardonius, when he saw that the Greeks would not come down into
the plain, sent all his cavalry, under Masistius (or Macistius, as the
Greeks call him), to attack them where they were. Now Masistius was
a man of much repute among the Persians, and rode a Nisaean charger
with a golden bit, and otherwise magnificently caparisoned. So the
horse advanced against the Greeks, and made attacks upon them in
divisions, doing them great damage at each charge, and insulting
them by calling them women.</p>
<p id="passage-26"><a href="#passage-26" class="passage-id">26</a> It chanced that the Megarians were drawn up in the position most
open to attack, and where the ground offered the best approach to
the cavalry. Finding themselves therefore hard pressed by the assaults
upon their ranks, they sent a herald to the Greek leaders, who came
and said to them, "This is the message of the Megarians- We cannot,
brothers-in-arms, continue to resist the Persian horse in that post
which we have occupied from the first, if we are left without
succours. Hitherto, although hard pressed, we have held out against
them firmly and courageously. Now, however, if you do not send
others to take our place, we warn you that we shall quit our post."
Such were the words of the herald. Pausanias, when he heard them,
inquired among his troops if there were any who would volunteer to
take the post, and so relieve the Megarians. Of the rest none were
willing to go, whereupon the Athenians offered themselves; and a
body of picked men, three hundred in number, commanded by
Olympiodorus, the son of Lampo, undertook the service.</p>
<p id="passage-27"><a href="#passage-27" class="passage-id">27</a> Selecting, to accompany them, the whole body of archers, these men
relieved the Megarians, and occupied a post which all the other Greeks
collected at Erythrae had shrunk from holding. After the struggle
had continued for a while, it came to an end on this wise. As the
barbarians continued charging in divisions, the horse of Masistius,
which was in front of the others, received an arrow in his flank,
the pain of which caused him to rear and throw his rider.
Immediately the Athenians rushed upon Masistius as he lay, caught
his horse, and when he himself made resistance, slew him. At first,
however, they were not able to take his life; for his armour
hindered them. He had on a breastplate formed of golden scales, with a
scarlet tunic covering it. Thus the blows, all falling upon his
breastplate, took no effect, till one of the soldiers, perceiving
the reason, drove his weapon into his eye and so slew him. All this
took place without any of the other horsemen seeing it: they had
neither observed their leader fall from his horse, nor beheld him
slain; for he fell as they wheeled round and prepared for another
charge, so that they were quite ignorant of what had happened. When,
however, they halted, and found that there was no one to marshal their
line, Masistius was missed; and instantly his soldiers,
understanding what must have befallen him, with loud cheers charged
the enemy in one mass, hoping to recover the dead body.</p>
<p id="passage-28"><a href="#passage-28" class="passage-id">28</a> So when the Athenians saw that, instead of coming up in squadrons,
the whole mass of the horse was about to charge them at once, they
called out to the other troops to make haste to their aid. While the
rest of the infantry, however, was moving to their assistance, the
contest waxed fierce about the dead body of Masistius. The three
hundred, so long as they fought by themselves, had greatly the worse
of the encounter, and were forced to retire and yield up the body to
the enemy; but when the other troops approached, the Persian horse
could no longer hold their ground, but fled without carrying off the
body, having incurred in the attempt a further loss of several of
their number. They therefore retired about two furlongs, and consulted
with each other what was best to be done. Being without a leader, it
seemed to them the fittest course to return to Mardonius.</p>
<p id="passage-29"><a href="#passage-29" class="passage-id">29</a> When the horse reached the camp, Mardonius and all the Persian
army made great lamentation for Masistius. They shaved off all the
hair from their own heads, and cut the manes from their war-horses and
their sumpter-beasts, while they vented their grief in such loud cries
that all Boeotia resounded with the clamour, because they had lost the
man who, next to Mardonius, was held in the greatest esteem, both by
the king and by the Persians generally. So the barbarians, after their
own fashion, paid honours to the dead Masistius.</p>
<p id="passage-30"><a href="#passage-30" class="passage-id">30</a> The Greeks, on the other hand, were greatly emboldened by what had
happened, seeing that they had not only stood their ground against the
attacks of the horse, but had even compelled them to beat a retreat.
They therefore placed the dead body of Masistius upon a cart, and
paraded it along the ranks of the army. Now the body was a sight which
well deserved to be gazed upon, being remarkable both for stature
and for beauty; and it was to stop the soldiers from leaving their
ranks to look at it, that they resolved to carry it round. After
this the Greeks determined to quit the high ground and go nearer
Plataea, as the land there seemed far more suitable for an
encampment than the country about Erythrae, particularly because it
was better supplied with water. To this place therefore, and more
especially to a spring-head which was called Gargaphia, they
considered that it would be best for them to remove, after which
they might once more encamp in their order. So they took their arms,
and proceeded along the slopes of Cithaeron, past Hysiae, to the
territory of the Plataeans; and here they drew themselves up, nation
by nation, close by the fountain Gargaphia, and the sacred precinct of
the Hero Androcrates, partly along some hillocks of no great height,
and partly upon the level of the plain.</p>
<p id="passage-31"><a href="#passage-31" class="passage-id">31</a> Here, in the marshalling of the nations, a fierce battle of
words arose between the Athenians and the Tegeans, both of whom
claimed to have one of the wings assigned to them. On each side were
brought forward the deeds which they had done, whether in earlier or
in later times; and first the Tegeans urged their claim as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-32"><a href="#passage-32" class="passage-id">32</a> "This post has been always considered our right, and not the right
of any of the other allies, in all the expeditions which have been
entered into conjointly by the Peloponnesians, both anciently and in
later times. Ever since the Heraclidae made their attempt, after the
death of Eurystheus, to return by force of arms into the
Peloponnese, this custom has been observed. It was then that the right
became ours, and this was the way in which we gained it:- When, in
company with the Achaeans and Ionians who then dwelt in the
Peloponnese, we marched out to the Isthmus, and pitched our camp
over against the invaders, then, as the tale goes, that Hyllus made
proclamation, saying- 'It needs not to imperil two armies in a general
battle; rather let one be chosen from the Peloponnesian ranks,
whomsoever they deem the bravest, and let him engage with me in single
combat, on such terms as shall be agreed upon.' The saying pleased the
Peloponnesians, and oaths were sworn to the effect following:- 'If
Hyllus conquer the Peloponnesian champion, the Heraclidae shall return
to their inheritance; if, on the other hand, he be conquered, the
Heraclidae shall withdraw, lead back their army, and engage for the
next hundred years to make no further endeavours to force their
return." Hereupon Echemus, the son of Aeropus and grandson of Phegeus,
who was our leader and king, offered himself, and was preferred before
all his brothers-in-arms as champion, engaged in single combat with
Hyllus, and slew him upon the spot. For this exploit we were
rewarded by the Peloponnesians of that day with many goodly
privileges, which we have ever since enjoyed; and, among the rest,
we obtained the right of holding the leading post in one wing,
whenever a joint expedition goes forth beyond our borders. With you
then, O Lacedaemonians, we do not claim to compete; choose you which
wing ye please; we yield and grant you the preference: but we maintain
that the command of the other wing belongs of right to us, now no less
than formerly. Moreover, set aside this exploit which we have related,
and still our title to the chief post is better than that of the
Athenians: witness the many glorious fights in which we have been
engaged against yourselves, O Spartans! as well as those which we have
maintained with others. We have therefore more right to this place
than they; for they have performed no exploits to be compared to ours,
whether we look to earlier or to later times."</p>
<p id="passage-33"><a href="#passage-33" class="passage-id">33</a> Thus spake the Tegeans; and the Athenians made reply as
follows:- "We are not ignorant that our forces were gathered here, not
for the purpose of speech-making, but for battle against the
barbarian. Yet as the Tegeans have been pleased to bring into debate
the exploits performed by our two nations, alike in carlier and in
later times, we have no choice but to set before you the grounds on
which we claim it as our heritage, deserved by our unchanging bravery,
to be preferred above Arcadians. In the first place, then, those
very Heraclidae, whose leader they boast to have slain at the Isthmus,
and whom the other Greeks would not receive when they asked a refuge
from the bondage wherewith they were threatened by the people of
Mycinae, were given a shelter by us; and we brought down the insolence
of Eurystheus, and helped to gain the victory over those who were at
that time lords of the Peloponnese. Again, when the Argives led
their troops with Polynices against Thebes, and were slain and refused
burial, it is our boast that we went out against the Cadmeians,
recovered the bodies, and buried them at Eleusis in our own territory.
Another noble deed of ours was that against the Amazons, when they
came from their seats upon the Thermodon, and poured their hosts
into Attica; and in the Trojan war too we were not a whit behind any
of the Greeks. But what boots it to speak of these ancient matters?
A nation which was brave in those days might have grown cowardly
since, and a nation of cowards then might now be valiant. Enough
therefore of our ancient achievements. Had we performed no other
exploit than that at Marathon- though in truth we have performed
exploits as many and as noble as any of the Greeks- yet had we
performed no other, we should deserve this privilege, and many a one
beside. There we stood alone, and singly fought with the Persians;
nay, and venturing on so dangerous a cast, we overcame the enemy,
and conquered on that day forty and six nations! Does not this one
achievement suffice to make good our title to the post we claim?
Nevertheless, Lacedaemonians, as to strive concerning place at such
a time as this is not right, we are ready to do as ye command, and
to take our station at whatever part of the line, and face whatever
nation ye think most expedient. Wheresoever ye place us, 'twill be our
endeavour to behave as brave men. Only declare your will, and we shall
at once obey you."</p>
<p id="passage-34"><a href="#passage-34" class="passage-id">34</a> Such was the reply of the Athenians; and forthwith all the
Lacedaemonian troops cried out with one voice, that the Athenians were
worthier to have the left wing than the Arcadians. In this way were
the Tegeans overcome; and the post was assigned to the Athenians.</p>
<p id="passage-35"><a href="#passage-35" class="passage-id">35</a> When this matter had been arranged, the Greek army, which was in
part composed of those who came at the first, in part of such as had
flocked in from day to day, drew up in the following order:- Ten
thousand Lacedaemonian troops held the right wing, five thousand of
whom were Spartans; and these five thousand were attended by a body of
thirty-five thousand Helots, who were only lightly armed- seven Helots
to each Spartan. The place next to themselves the Spartans gave to the
Tegeans, on account of their courage and of the esteem in which they
held them. They were all fully armed, and numbered fifteen hundred
men. Next in order came the Corinthians, five thousand strong; and
with them Pausanias had placed, at their request, the band of three
hundred which had come from Potidaea in Pallene. The Arcadians of
Orchomenus, in number six hundred, came next; then the Sicyonians,
three thousand; then the Epidaurians, eight hundred; then the
Troezenians, one thousand; then the Lepreats, two hundred; the
Mycenaeans and Tirynthians, four hundred; the Phliasians, one
thousand; the Hermionians, three hundred; the Eretrians and
Styreans, six hundred; the Chalcideans, four hundred; and the
Ambraciots, five hundred. After these came the Leucadians and
Anactorians, who numbered eight hundred; the Paleans of Cephallenia,
two hundred; the Eginetans, five hundred; the Megarians, three
thousand; and the Plataeans, six hundred. Last of all, but first at
their extremity of the line, were the Athenians, who, to the number of
eight thousand, occupied the left wing, under the command of
Aristides, the son of Lysimachus.</p>
<p id="passage-36"><a href="#passage-36" class="passage-id">36</a> All these, except the Helots- seven of whom, as I said, attended
each Spartan- were heavy-armed troops; and they amounted to
thirty-eight thousand seven hundred men. This was the number of
Hoplites, or heavy-armed soldiers, which was together against the
barbarian. The light-armed troops consisted of the thirty-five
thousand ranged with the Spartans, seven in attendance upon each,
who were all well equipped for war; and of thirty-four thousand five
hundred others, belonging to the Lacedaemonians and the rest of the
Greeks, at the rate (nearly) of one light to one heavy armed. Thus the
entire number of the light-armed was sixty-nine thousand five hundred.</p>
<p id="passage-37"><a href="#passage-37" class="passage-id">37</a> The Greek army, therefore, which mustered at Plataea, counting
light-armed as well as heavy-armed, was but eighteen hundred men short
of one hundred and ten thousand; and this amount was exactly made up
by the Thespians who were present in the camp; for eighteen hundred
Thespians, being the whole number left, were likewise with the army;
but these men were without arms. Such was the array of the Greek
troops when they took post on the Asopus.</p>
<p id="passage-38"><a href="#passage-38" class="passage-id">38</a> The barbarians under Mardonius, when the mourning for Masistius
was at an end, and they learnt that the Greeks were in the Plataean
territory, moved likewise towards the river Asopus, which flows in
those parts. On their arrival Mardonius marshalled them against the
Greeks in the following order:- Against the Lacedaemonians he posted
his Persians; and as the Persians were far more numerous he drew
them up with their ranks deeper than common, and also extended their
front so that part faced the Tegeans; and here he took care to
choose out the best troops to face the Lacedaemonians, whilst
against the Tegeans he arrayed those on whom he could not so much
depend. This was done at the suggestion and by the advice of the
Thebans. Next to the Persians he placed the Medes, facing the
Corinthians, Potidaeans, Orchomenians, and Sicyonians; then the
Bactrians, facing the Epidaurians, Troezenians, Lepreats, Tirynthians,
Mycenaeans, and Phliasians; after them the Indians, facing the
Hermionians, Eretrians, Styreans, and Chalcidians; then the Sacans,
facing the Ambraciots, Anactorians, Leucadians, Paleans, and
Eginetans; last of all, facing the Athenians, the Plataeans, and the
Megarians, he placed the troops of the Boeotians, Locrians, Malians,
and Thessalians, and also the thousand Phocians. The whole nation of
the Phocians had not joined the Medes; on the contrary, there were
some who had gathered themselves into bands about Parnassus, and
made expeditions from thence, whereby they distressed Mardonius and
the Greeks who sided with him, and so did good service to the
Grecian cause. Besides those mentioned above, Mardonius likewise
arrayed against the Athenians the Macedonians and the tribes
dwelling about Thessaly.</p>
<p id="passage-39"><a href="#passage-39" class="passage-id">39</a> I have named here the greatest of the nations which were
marshalled by Mardonius on this occasion, to wit, all those of most
renown and account. Mixed with these, however, were men of divers
other peoples, as Phrygians, Thracians, Mysians, Paeonians, and the
like; Ethiopians again, and Egyptians, both of the Hermotybian and
Calascirian races, whose weapon is the sword, and who are the only
fighting men in that country. These persons had formerly served on
board the fleet of Xerxes, but Mardonius disembarked them before he
left Phalerum; in the land force which Xerxes brought to Athens
there were no Egyptians. The number of the barbarians, as I have
already mentioned, was three hundred thousand; that of the Greeks
who had made alliance with Mardonius is known to none, for they were
never counted: I should guess that they mustered near fifty thousand
strong. The troops thus marshalled were all foot soldiers. As for
the horse, it was drawn up by itself.</p>
<p id="passage-40"><a href="#passage-40" class="passage-id">40</a> When the marshalling of Mardonius' troops by nations and by
maniples was ended, the two armies proceeded on the next day to
offer sacrifice. The Grecian sacrifice was offered by Tisamenus, the
son of Antiochus, who accompanied the army as soothsayer: he was an
Elean, and belonged to the Clytiad branch of the Iamidae, but had been
admitted among their own citizens by the Lacedaemonians. Now his
admission among them was on this wise:- Tisamenus had gone to Delphi
to consult the god concerning his lack of offspring, when it was
declared to him by the Pythoness that he would win five very
glorious combats. Misunderstanding the oracle, and imagining that he
was to win combats in the games, Tisamenus at once applied himself
to the practice of gymnastics. He trained himself for the
Pentathlum, and, on contending at Olympia, came within a little of
winning it; for he was successful in everything, except the
wrestling-match, which was carried off by Hieronymus the Andrian.
Hereon the Lacedaemonians perceived that the combats of which the
oracle spoke were not combats in the games, but battles: they
therefore sought to induce Tisamenus to hire out his services to them,
in order that they might join him with their Heracleid kings in the
conduct of their wars. He however, when he saw that they set great
store by his friendship, forthwith raised his price, and told them,
"If they would receive him among their citizens, and give him equal
rights with the rest, he was willing to do as they desired, but on
no other terms would they ever gain his consent." The Spartans, when
they heard this, at first thought it monstrous, and ceased to
implore his aid. Afterwards, however, when the fearful danger of the
Persian war hung over their heads, they sent for him and agreed to his
terms; but Tisamenus now, perceiving them so changed, declared, "He
could no longer be content with what he had asked before: they must
likewise make his brother Hagias a Spartan, with the same rights as
himself."</p>
<p id="passage-41"><a href="#passage-41" class="passage-id">41</a> In acting thus he did but follow the example once set by Melampus,
at least if kingship may be compared with citizenship. For when the
women of Argos were seized with madness, and the Argives would have
hired Melampus to come from Pylos and heal them of their disease, he
demanded as his reward one-half of the kingdom; but as the Argives
disdained to stoop to this, they left him and went their way.
Afterwards, however, when many more of their women were seized, they
brought themselves to agree to his terms; and accordingly they went
again to him, and said they were content to give what he required.
Hereon Melampus, seeing them so changed, raised his demand, and told
them, "Except they would give his brother Bias one-third of the
kingdom likewise, he would not do as they wished." So, as the
Argives were in a strait, they consented even to this.</p>
<p id="passage-42"><a href="#passage-42" class="passage-id">42</a> In like manner the Spartans, as they were in great need of
Tisamenus, yielded everything: and Tisamenus the Elean, having in this
way become a Spartan citizen, afterwards, in the capacity of
soothsayer, helped the Spartans to gain five very glorious combats. He
and his brother were the only men whom the Spartans ever admitted to
citizenship. The five combats were these following:- The first was the
combat at Plataea; the second, that near Tegea, against the Tegeans
and the Argives; the third, that at Dipaeeis, against all the
Arcadians excepting those of Mantinea; the fourth, that at the
Isthmus, against the Messenians; and the fifth, that at Tanagra,
against the Athenians and the Argives. The battle here fought was
the last of all the five.</p>
<p id="passage-43"><a href="#passage-43" class="passage-id">43</a> The Spartans had now brought Tisamenus with them to the Plataean
territory, where he acted as soothsayer for the Greeks. He found the
victims favourable, if the Greeks stood on the defensive, but not if
they began the battle or crossed the river Asopus.</p>
<p id="passage-44"><a href="#passage-44" class="passage-id">44</a> With Mardonius also, who was very eager to begin the battle, the
victims were not favourable for so doing; but he likewise found them
bode him well, if he was content to stand on his defence. He too had
made use of the Grecian rites; for Hegesistratus, an Elean, and the
most renowned of the Telliads, was his soothsayer. This man had once
been taken captive by the Spartans, who, considering that he had
done them many grievous injuries, laid him in bonds, with the intent
to put him to death. Thereupon Hegesistratus, finding himself in so
sore a case, since not only was his life in danger, but he knew that
he would have to suffer torments of many kinds before his death,-
Hegesistratus, I say, did a deed for which no words suffice. He had
been set with one foot in the stocks, which were of wood but bound
with iron bands; and in this condition received from without an iron
implement, wherewith he contrived to accomplish the most courageous
deed upon record. Calculating how much of his foot he would be able to
draw through the hole, he cut off the front portion with his own hand;
and then, as he was guarded by watchmen, forced a way through the wall
of his prison, and made his escape to Tegea, travelling during the
night, but in the daytime stealing into the woods, and staying
there. In this way, though the Lacedaemonians went out in full force
to search for him, he nevertheless escaped, and arrived the third
evening at Tegea. So the Spartans were amazed at the man's
endurance, when they saw on the ground the piece which he had cut
off his foot, and yet for all their seeking could not find him
anywhere. Hegesistratus, having thus escaped the Lacedaemonians,
took refuge in Tegea; for the Tegeans at that time were ill friends
with the Lacedaemonians. When his wound was healed, he procured
himself a wooden foot, and became an open enemy to Sparta. At the
last, however, this enmity brought him to trouble; for the Spartans
took him captive as he was exercising his office in Zacynthus, and
forthwith put him to death. But these things happened some while after
the fight at Plataea. At present he was serving Mardonius on the
Asopus, having been hired at no inconsiderable price; and here he
offered sacrifice with a right good will, in part from his hatred of
the Lacedaemonians, in part for lucre's sake.</p>
<p id="passage-45"><a href="#passage-45" class="passage-id">45</a> So when the victims did not allow either the Persians or their
Greek allies to begin the battle- these Greeks had their own
soothsayer in the person of Hippomachus, a Leucadian- and when
soldiers continued to pour into the opposite camp and the numbers on
the Greek side to increase continually, Timagenidas, the son of
Herpys, a Theban, advised Mardonius to keep a watch on the passes of
Cithaeron, telling him how supplies of men kept flocking in day
after day, and assuring him that he might cut off large numbers.</p>
<p id="passage-46"><a href="#passage-46" class="passage-id">46</a> It was eight days after the two armies first encamped opposite
to one another when this advice was given by Timagenidas. Mardonius,
seeing it to be good, as soon as evening came, sent his cavalry to
that pass of Mount Cithaeron which opens out upon Plataea, a pass
called by the Boeotians the "Three Heads," called the "Oak-Heads" by
the Athenians. The horse sent on this errand did not make the movement
in vain. They came upon a body of five hundred sumpter-beasts which
were just entering the plain, bringing provisions to the Greek camp
from the Peloponnese, with a number of men driving them. Seeing this
prey in their power, the Persians set upon them and slaughtered
them, sparing none, neither man nor beast; till at last, when they had
had enough of slaying, they secured such as were left, and bore them
off to the camp to Mardonius.</p>
<p id="passage-47"><a href="#passage-47" class="passage-id">47</a> After this they waited again for two days more, neither army
wishing to begin the fight. The barbarians indeed advanced as far as
the Asopus, and endeavoured to tempt the Greeks to cross; but
neither side actually passed the stream. Still the cavalry of
Mardonius harassed and annoyed the Greeks incessantly; for the
Thebans, who were zealous in the cause of the Medes, pressed the war
forward with all eagerness, and often led the charge till the lines
met, when the Medes and Persians took their place, and displayed, many
of them, uncommon valour.</p>
<p id="passage-48"><a href="#passage-48" class="passage-id">48</a> For ten days nothing was done more than this; but on the
eleventh day from the time when the two hosts first took station,
one over against the other, near Plataea- the number of the Greeks
being now much greater than it was at the first, and Mardonius being
impatient of the delay- there was a conference held between Mardonius,
son of Gobryas, and Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, a man who was
esteemed by Xerxes more than almost any of the Persians. At this
consultation the following were the opinions delivered:- Artabazus
thought it would be best for them to break up from their quarters as
soon as possible, and withdraw the whole army to the fortified town of
Thebes, where they had abundant stores of corn for themselves, and
of fodder for the sumpter-beasts. There, he said, they had only to sit
quiet, and the war might be brought to an end on this wise:- Coined
gold was plentiful in the camp, and uncoined gold too; they had silver
moreover in great abundance, and drinking-cups. Let them not spare
to take of these, and distribute them among the Greeks, especially
among the leaders in the several cities; 'twould not be long before
the Greeks gave up their liberty, without risking another battle for
it. Thus the opinion of Artabazus agreed with that of the Thebans; for
he too had more foresight than some. Mardonius, on the other hand,
expressed himself with more fierceness and obstinacy, and was
utterly disinclined to yield. "Their army," he said, "was vastly
superior to that of the Greeks; and they had best engage at once,
and not wait till greater numbers were gathered against them. As for
Hegesistratus and his victims, they should let them pass unheeded, not
seeking to force them to be favourable, but, according to the old
Persian custom, hasting to join battle."</p>
<p id="passage-49"><a href="#passage-49" class="passage-id">49</a> When Mardonius had thus declared his sentiments, no one ventured
to say him nay; and accordingly his opinion prevailed, for it was to
him, and not to Artabazus, that the king had given the command of
the army.</p>
<p id="passage-50"><a href="#passage-50" class="passage-id">50</a> Mardonius now sent for the captains of the squadrons, and the
leaders of the Greeks in his service, and questioned them:- "Did
they know of any prophecy which said that the Persians were to be
destroyed in Greece?" All were silent; some because they did not
know the prophecies, but others, who knew them full well, because they
did not think it safe to speak out. So Mardonius, when none
answered, said, "Since ye know of no such oracle, or do not dare to
speak of it, I, who know it well, will myself declare it to you. There
is an oracle which says that the Persians shall come into Greece, sack
the temple at Delphi, and when they have so done, perish one and
all. Now we, as we are aware of the prediction, will neither go
against the temple  nor make any attempt to sack it: we therefore
shall not perish for this trespass. Rejoice then thus far, all ye
who are well-wishers to the Persians, and doubt not we shall get the
better of the Greeks." When he had so spoken, he further ordered
them to prepare themselves, and to put all in readiness for a battle
upon the morrow.</p>
<p id="passage-51"><a href="#passage-51" class="passage-id">51</a> As for the oracle of which Mardonius spoke, and which he
referred to the Persians, it did not, I am well assured, mean them,
but the Illyrians and the Enchelean host. There are, however, some
verses of Bacis which did speak of this battle:-</p>
<p id="passage-52"><a href="#passage-52" class="passage-id">52</a> > By Thermodon's stream, and the grass-clad hanks of Asopus,  
> See where gather the Grecians, and hark to the foreigners'
>   war-shout-  
> There in death shall lie, ere fate or Lachesis doomed him,  
> Many a bow-bearing Mede, when the day of calamity cometh.</p>
<p id="passage-53"><a href="#passage-53" class="passage-id">53</a> These verses, and some others like them which Musaeus wrote, referred,
I well know, to the Persians. The river Thermodon flows between
Tanagra and Glisas.</p>
<p id="passage-54"><a href="#passage-54" class="passage-id">54</a> After Mardonius had put his question about the prophecies, and
spoken the above words of encouragement, night drew on apace, and on
both sides the watches were set. As soon then as there was silence
throughout the camp,- the night being now well advanced, and the men
seeming to be in their deepest sleep,- Alexander, the son of
Amyntas, king and leader of the Macedonians, rode up on horseback to
the Athenian outposts, and desired to speak with the generals.
Hereupon, while the greater part continued on guard, some of the watch
ran to the chiefs, and told them, "There had come a horseman from
the Median camp who would not say a word, except that he wished to
speak with the generals, of whom he mentioned the names."</p>
<p id="passage-55"><a href="#passage-55" class="passage-id">55</a> They at once, hearing this, made haste to the outpost, where
they found Alexander, who addressed them as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-56"><a href="#passage-56" class="passage-id">56</a> "Men of Athens, that which I am about to say I trust to your
honour; and I charge you to keep it secret from all excepting
Pausanias, if you would not bring me to destruction. Had I not greatly
at heart the common welfare of Greece, I should not have come to
tell you; but I am myself a Greek by descent, and I would not
willingly see Greece exchange freedom for slavery. Know then that
Mardonius and his army cannot obtain favourable omens; had it not been
for this, they would have fought with you long ago. Now, however, they
have determined to let the victims pass unheeded, and, as soon as
day dawns, to engage in battle. Mardonius, I imagine, is afraid
that, if he delays, you will increase in number. Make ready then to
receive him. Should he however still defer the combat, do you abide
where you are; for his provisions will not hold out many more days. If
ye prosper in this war, forget not to do something for my freedom;
consider the risk I have run, out of zeal for the Greek cause, to
acquaint you with what Mardonius intends, and to save you from being
surprised by the barbarians. I am Alexander of Macedon."</p>
<p id="passage-57"><a href="#passage-57" class="passage-id">57</a> As soon as he had said this, Alexander rode back to the camp,
and returned to the station assigned him.</p>
<p id="passage-58"><a href="#passage-58" class="passage-id">58</a> Meanwhile the Athenian generals hastened to the right wing, and
told Pausanias all that they had learnt from Alexander. Hereupon
Pausanias, who no sooner heard the intention of the Persians than he
was struck with fear, addressed the generals, and said,-</p>
<p id="passage-59"><a href="#passage-59" class="passage-id">59</a> "Since the battle is to come with to-morrow's dawn, it were well
that you Athenians should stand opposed to the Persians, and we
Spartans to the Boeotians and the other Greeks; for ye know the
Medes and their manner of fight, since ye have already fought with
them once at Marathon, but we are quite ignorant and without any
experience of their warfare. While, however, there is not a Spartan
here present who has ever fought against a Mede, of the Boeotians
and Thessalians we have had experience. Take then your arms, and march
over to our post upon the right, while we supply your place in the
left wing."</p>
<p id="passage-60"><a href="#passage-60" class="passage-id">60</a> Hereto the Athenians replied- "We, too, long ago, when we saw that
the Persians were drawn up to face you, were minded to suggest to
you the very course which you have now been the first to bring
forward. We feared, however, that perhaps our words might not be
pleasing to you. But, as you have now spoken of these things
yourselves, we gladly give our consent, and are ready to do as ye have
said."</p>
<p id="passage-61"><a href="#passage-61" class="passage-id">61</a> Both sides agreeing hereto, at the dawn of day the Spartans and
Athenians changed places. But the movement was perceived by the
Boeotians, and they gave notice of it to Mardonius; who at once, on
hearing what had been done, made a change in the disposition of his
own forces, and brought the Persians to face the Lacedaemonians.
Then Pausanias, finding that his design was discovered, led back his
Spartans to the right wing; and Mardonius, seeing this, replaced his
Persians upon the left of his army.</p>
<p id="passage-62"><a href="#passage-62" class="passage-id">62</a> When the troops again occupied their former posts, Mardonius
sent a herald to the Spartans, who spoke as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-63"><a href="#passage-63" class="passage-id">63</a> "Lacedaemonians, in these parts the men say that you are the
bravest of mankind, and admire you because you never turn your backs
in flight nor quit your ranks, but always stand firm, and either die
at your posts or else destroy your adversaries. But in all this
which they say concerning you there is not one word of truth; for
now have we seen you, before battle was joined or our two hosts had
come to blows, flying and leaving your posts, wishing the Athenians to
make the first trial of our arms, and taking your own station
against our slaves. Surely these are not the deeds of brave men.
Much do we find ourselves deceived in you; for we believed the reports
of you that reached our ears, and expected that you would send a
herald with a challenge to us, proposing to fight by yourselves
against our division of native Persians. We for our part were ready to
have agreed to this; but ye have made us no such offer- nay! ye seem
rather to shrink from meeting us. However, as no challenge of this
kind comes from you to us, lo! we send a challenge to you. Why
should not you on the part of the Greeks, as you are thought to be the
bravest of all, and we on the part of the barbarians, fight a battle
with equal numbers on both sides? Then, if it seems good to the others
to fight likewise, let them engage afterwards- but if not,- if they
are content that we should fight on behalf of all, let us so do- and
whichever side wins the battle, let them win it for their whole army."</p>
<p id="passage-64"><a href="#passage-64" class="passage-id">64</a> When the herald had thus spoken, he waited a while, but, as no one
made him any answer, he went back, and told Mardonius what had
happened. Mardonius was full of joy thereat, and so puffed up by the
empty victory, that he at once gave orders to his horse to charge
the Greek line. Then the horsemen drew near, and with their javelins
and their arrows- for though horsemen they used the bow- sorely
distressed the Greek troops, which could not bring them to close
combat. The fountain of Gargaphia, whence the whole Greek army drew
its water, they at this time choked up and spoiled. The Lacedaemonians
were the only troops who had their station near this fountain; the
other Greeks were more or less distant from it, according to their
place in the line; they however were not far from the Asopus. Still,
as the Persian horse with their missile weapons did not allow them
to approach, and so they could not get their water from the river,
these Greeks, no less than the Lacedaemonians, resorted at this time
to the fountain.</p>
<p id="passage-65"><a href="#passage-65" class="passage-id">65</a> When the fountain was choked, the Grecian captains, seeing that
the army had no longer a water-place, and observing moreover that
the cavalry greatly harassed them, held a meeting on these and other
matters at the headquarters of Pausanias upon the right. For besides
the above-named difficulties, which were great enough, other
circumstances added to their distress. All the provisions that they
had brought with them were gone; and the attendants who had been
sent to fetch supplies from the Peloponnese, were prevented from
returning to camp by the Persian horse, which had now closed the
passage.</p>
<p id="passage-66"><a href="#passage-66" class="passage-id">66</a> The captains therefore held a council, whereat it was agreed, that
if the Persians did not give battle that day, the Greeks should move
to the Island- a tract of ground which lies in front of Plataea, at
the distance of ten furlongs from the Asopus and fount Gargaphia,
where the army was encamped at that time. This tract was a sort of
island in the continent: for there is a river which, dividing near its
source, runs down from Mount Cithaeron into the plain below in two
streams, flowing in channels about three furlongs apart, which after a
while unite and become one. The name of this river is Oeroe, and the
dwellers in those parts call it, the daughter of the Asopus. This
was the place to which the Greeks resolved to remove; and they chose
it, first because they would there have no lack of water, and
secondly, because the horse could not harass them as when it was drawn
up right in their front. They thought it best to begin their march
at the second watch of the night, lest the Persians should see them as
they left their station, and should follow and harass them with
their cavalry. It was agreed likewise, that after they had reached the
place, which the Asopus-born Oeroe surrounds, as it flows down from
Cithaeron, they should despatch, the very same night, one half of
their army towards that mountain-range, to relieve those whom they had
sent to procure provisions, and who were now blocked up in that
region.</p>
<p id="passage-67"><a href="#passage-67" class="passage-id">67</a> Having made these resolves, they continued during that whole day
to suffer beyond measure from the attacks of the enemy's horse. At
length when towards dusk the attacks of the horse ceased, and, night
having closed in, the hour arrived at which the army was to commence
its retreat, the greater number struck their tents and began the march
towards the rear. They were not minded, however, to make for the place
agreed upon; but in their anxiety to escape from the Persian horse, no
sooner had they begun to move than they fled straight to Plataea;
where they took post at the temple of Juno, which lies outside the
city, at the distance of about twenty furlongs from Gargaphia; and
here they pitched their camp in front of the sacred building.</p>
<p id="passage-68"><a href="#passage-68" class="passage-id">68</a> As soon as Pausanias saw a portion of the troops in motion, he
issued orders to the Lacedaemonians to strike their tents and follow
those who had been the first to depart, supposing that they were on
their march to the place agreed upon. All the captains but one were
ready to obey his orders: Amompharetus, however, the son of
Poliadas, who was leader of the Pitanate cohort, refused to move,
saying, "He for one would not fly from the strangers, or of his own
will bring disgrace upon Sparta." It had happened that he was absent
from the former conference of the captains; and so what was now taking
place astonished him. Pausanias and Euryanax thought it a monstrous
thing that Amompharetus would not hearken to them; but considered that
it would be yet more monstrous, if, when he was so minded, they were
to leave the Pitanates to their fate; seeing that, if they forsook
them to keep their agreement with the other Greeks, Amompharetus and
those with him might perish. On this account, therefore, they kept the
Lacedaemonian force in its place, and made every endeavour to persuade
Amompharetus that he was wrong to act as he was doing.</p>
<p id="passage-69"><a href="#passage-69" class="passage-id">69</a> While the Spartans were engaged in these efforts to turn
Amompharetus- the only man unwilling to retreat either in their own
army or in that of the Tegeans- the Athenians on their side did as
follows. Knowing that it was the Spartan temper to say one thing and
no another, they remained quiet in their station until the army
began to retreat, when they despatched a horseman to see whether the
Spartans really meant to set forth, or whether after all they had no
intention of moving. The horseman was also to ask Pausanias what he
wished the Athenians to do.</p>
<p id="passage-70"><a href="#passage-70" class="passage-id">70</a> The herald on his arrival found the Lacedaemonians drawn up in
their old position, and their leaders quarrelling with one another.
Pausanias and Euryanax had gone on urging Amompharetus not to endanger
the lives of his men by staying behind while the others drew off,
but without succeeding in persuading him; until at last the dispute
had waxed hot between them just at the moment when the Athenian herald
arrived. At this point Amompharetus, who was still disputing, took
up with both his hands a vast rock, and placed it at the feet of
Pausanias, saying- "With this pebble I give my vote not to run away
from the strangers." (By "strangers" he meant barbarians.)
Pausanias, in reply, called him a fool and a madman, and, turning to
the Athenian herald, who had made the inquiries with which he was
charged, bade him tell his countrymen how he was occupied, and ask
them to approach nearer, and retreat or not according to the movements
of the Spartans.</p>
<p id="passage-71"><a href="#passage-71" class="passage-id">71</a> So the herald went back to the Athenians; and the Spartans
continued to dispute till morning began to dawn upon them. Then
Pausanias, who as yet had not moved, gave the signal for retreat-
expecting (and rightly, as the event proved) that Amompharetus, when
he saw the rest of the Lacedaemonians in motion, would be unwilling to
be left behind. No sooner was the signal given, than all the army
except the Pitanates began their march, and retreated along the line
of the hills; the Tegeans accompanying them. The Athenians likewise
set off in good order, but proceeded by a different way from the
Lacedaemonians. For while the latter clung to the hilly ground and the
skirts of Mount Cithaeron, on account of the fear which they
entertained of the enemy's horse, the former betook themselves to
the low country and marched through the plain.</p>
<p id="passage-72"><a href="#passage-72" class="passage-id">72</a> As for Amompharetus, at first he did not believe that Pausanias
would really dare to leave him behind; he therefore remained firm in
his resolve to keep his men at their post; when, however, Pausanias
and his troops were now some way off, Amompharetus, thinking himself
forsaken in good earnest, ordered his band to take their arms, and led
them at a walk towards the main army. Now the army was waiting for
them at a distance of about ten furlongs, having halted upon the river
Moloeis at a place called Argiopius, where stands a temple dedicated
to Eleusinian Ceres. They had stopped here, that, in case Amompharetus
and his band should refuse to quit the spot where they were drawn
up, and should really not stir from it, they might have it in their
power to move back and lend them assistance. Amompharetus, however,
and his companions rejoined the main body; and at the same time the
whole mass of the barbarian cavalry arrived and began to press hard
upon them. The horsemen had followed their usual practice and ridden
up to the Greek camp, when they discovered that the place where the
Greeks had been posted hitherto was deserted. Hereupon they pushed
forward without stopping, and, as soon as they overtook the enemy,
pressed heavily on them.</p>
<p id="passage-73"><a href="#passage-73" class="passage-id">73</a> Mardonius, when he heard that the Greeks had retired under cover
of the night, and beheld the place, where they had been stationed,
empty, called to him Thorax of Larissa, and his brethren, Eurypylus
and Thrasideius, and said:-</p>
<p id="passage-74"><a href="#passage-74" class="passage-id">74</a> "O sons of Aleuas! what will ye say now, when ye see yonder
place empty? Why, you, who dwell in their neighbourhood, told me the
Lacedaemonians never fled from battle, but were brave beyond all the
rest of mankind. Lately, however, you yourselves beheld them change
their place in the line; and here, as all may see, they have run
away during the night. Verily, when their turn came to fight with
those who are of a truth the bravest warriors in all the world, they
showed plainly enough that they are men of no worth, who have
distinguished themselves among Greeks- men likewise of no worth at
all. However, I can readily excuse you, who, knowing nothing of the
Persians, praised these men from your acquaintance with certain
exploits of theirs; but I marvel all the more at Artabazus, that he
should have been afraid of the Lacedaemonians, and have therefore
given us so dastardly a counsel,- bidding us, as did, break up our
camp, and remove to Thebes, and there allow ourselves to be besieged
by the Greeks- advice whereof I shall take care to inform the king.
But of this hereafter. Now we must not allow them to escape us, but
must pursue after them till we overtake them; and then we must exact
vengeance for all the wrongs which have been suffered at their hands
by the Persians."</p>
<p id="passage-75"><a href="#passage-75" class="passage-id">75</a> When he had so spoken, he crossed the Asopus, and led the Persians
forward at a run directly upon the track of the Greeks, whom he
believed to be in actual flight. He could not see the Athenians;
for, as they had taken the way of the plain, they were hidden from his
sight by the hills; he therefore led on his troops against the
Lacedaemonians and the Tegeans only. When the commanders of the
other divisions of the barbarians saw the Persians pursuing the Greeks
so hastily, they all forthwith seized their standards, and hurried
after at their best speed in great disorder and disarray. On they went
with loud shouts and in a wild rout, thinking to swallow up the
runaways.</p>
<p id="passage-76"><a href="#passage-76" class="passage-id">76</a> Meanwhile Pausanias had sent a horseman to the Athenians, at the
time when the cavalry first fell upon him, with this message:-</p>
<p id="passage-77"><a href="#passage-77" class="passage-id">77</a> "Men of Athens! now that the great struggle has come, which is
to decide the freedom or the slavery of Greece, we twain,
Lacedaemonians and Athenians, are deserted by all the other allies,
who have fled away from us during the past night. Nevertheless, we are
resolved what to do- we must endeavour, as best we may, to defend
ourselves and to succour one another. Now, had the horse fallen upon
you first, we ourselves with the Tegeans (who remain faithful to the
Greek cause) would have been bound to render you assistance against
them. As, however, the entire body has advanced upon us, 'tis your
place to come to our aid, sore pressed as we are by the enemy.
Should you yourselves be so straitened that you cannot come, at
least send us your archers, and be sure you will earn our gratitude.
We acknowledge that throughout this whole war there has been no zeal
to be compared to yours- we therefore doubt not that you will do us
this service."</p>
<p id="passage-78"><a href="#passage-78" class="passage-id">78</a> The Athenians, as soon as they received this message, were anxious
to go to the aid of the Spartans, and to help them to the uttermost of
their power; but, as they were upon the march, the Greeks on the
king's side, whose place in the line had been opposite theirs, fell
upon them, and so harassed them by their attacks that it was not
possible for them to give the succour they desired. Accordingly the
Lacedaemonians, and the Tegeans- whom nothing could induce to quit
their side- were left alone to resist the Persians. Including the
light-armed, the number of the former was 50,000; while that of the
Tegeans was 3000. Now, therefore, as they were about to engage with
Mardonius and the troops under him, they made ready to offer
sacrifice. The victims, however, for some time were not favourable;
and, during the delay, many fell on the Spartan side, and a still
greater number were wounded. For the Persians had made a rampart of
their wicker shields, and shot from behind them stich clouds of
arrows, that the Spartans were sorely distressed. The victims
continued unpropitious; till at last Pausanias raised his eyes to
the Heraeum of the Plataeans, and calling the goddess to his aid,
besought her not to disappoint the hopes of the Greeks.</p>
<p id="passage-79"><a href="#passage-79" class="passage-id">79</a> As he offered his prayer, the Tegeans, advancing before the
rest, rushed forward against the enemy; and the Lacedaemonians, who
had obtained favourable omens the moment that Pausanias prayed, at
length, after their long delay, advanced to the attack; while the
Persians, on their side, left shooting, and prepared to meet them. And
first the combat was at the wicker shields. Afterwards, when these
were swept down, a fierce contest took Place by the side of the temple
of Ceres, which lasted long, and ended in a hand-to-hand struggle. The
barbarians many times seized hold of the Greek spears and brake
them; for in boldness and warlike spirit the Persians were not a
whit inferior to the Greeks; but they were without bucklers,
untrained, and far below the enemy in respect of skill in arms.
Sometimes singly, sometimes in bodies of ten, now fewer and now more
in number, they dashed upon the Spartan ranks, and so perished.</p>
<p id="passage-80"><a href="#passage-80" class="passage-id">80</a> The fight went most against the Greeks, where Mardonius, mounted
upon a white horse, and surrounded by the bravest of all the Persians,
the thousand picked men, fought in person. So long as Mardonius was
alive, this body resisted all attacks, and, while they defended
their own lives, struck down no small number of Spartans; but after
Mardonius fell, and the troops with him, which were the main
strength of the army, perished, the remainder yielded to the
Lacedaemonians, and took to flight. Their light clothing, and want
of bucklers, were of the greatest hurt to them: for they had to
contend against men heavily armed, while they themselves were
without any such defence.</p>
<p id="passage-81"><a href="#passage-81" class="passage-id">81</a> Then was the warning of the oracle fulfilled; and the vengeance
which was due to the Spartans for the slaughter of Leonidas was paid
them by Mardonius- then too did Pausanias, the son of Cleombrotus, and
grandson of Anaxandridas (I omit to recount his other ancestors, since
they are the same with those of Leonidas), win a victory exceeding
in glory all those to which our knowledge extends. Mardonius was slain
by Aeimnestus, a man famous in Sparta- the same who in the Messenian
war, which came after the struggle against the Medes, fought a
battle near Stenyclerus with but three hundred men against the whole
force of the Messenians, and himself perished, and the three hundred
with him.</p>
<p id="passage-82"><a href="#passage-82" class="passage-id">82</a> The Persians, as soon as they were put to flight by the
Lacedaemonians, ran hastily away, without preserving any order, and
took refuge in their own camp, within the wooden defence which they
had raised in the Theban territory. It is a marvel to me how it came
to pass, that although the battle was fought quite close to the
grove of Ceres, yet not a single Persian appears to have died on the
sacred soil, nor even to have set foot upon it, while round about
the precinct, in the unconsecrated ground, great numbers perished. I
imagine- if it is lawful, in matters which concern the gods, to
imagine anything- that the goddess herself kept them out, because they
had burnt her dwelling at Eleusis. Such, then, was the issue of this
battle.</p>
<p id="passage-83"><a href="#passage-83" class="passage-id">83</a> Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, who had disapproved from the
first of the king's leaving Mardonius behind him, and had made great
endeavours, but all in vain, to dissuade Mardonius from risking a
battle, when he found that the latter was bent on acting otherwise
than he wished, did as follows. He had a force under his orders
which was far from inconsiderable, amounting, as it did, to near forty
thousand men. Being well aware, therefore, how the battle was likely
to go, as soon as the two armies began to fight, he led his soldiers
forward in an orderly array, bidding them one and all proceed at the
same pace, and follow him with such celerity as they should observe
him to use. Having issued these commands, he pretended to lead them to
the battle. But when, advancing before his army, he saw that the
Persians were already in flight, instead of keeping the same order, he
wheeled his troops suddenly round, and beat a retreat; nor did he even
seek shelter within the palisade or behind the walls of Thebes, but
hurried on into Phocis, wishing to make his way to the Hellespont with
all possible speed. Such accordingly was the course which these
Persians took.</p>
<p id="passage-84"><a href="#passage-84" class="passage-id">84</a> As for the Greeks upon the king's side, while most of them
played the coward purposely, the Boeotians, on the contrary, had a
long struggle with the Athenians. Those of the Thebans who were
attached to the Medes, displayed especially no little zeal; far from
playing the coward, they fought with such fury that three hundred of
the best and bravest among them were slain by the Athenians in this
passage of arms. But at last they too were routed, and fled away- not,
however, in the same direction as the Persians and the crowd of
allies, who, having taken no part in the battle, ran off without
striking a blow- but to the city of Thebes.</p>
<p id="passage-85"><a href="#passage-85" class="passage-id">85</a> To me it shows very clearly how completely the rest of the
barbarians were dependent upon the Persian troops, that here they
all fled at once, without ever coming to blows with the enemy,
merely because they saw the Persians running away. And so it came to
pass that the whole army took to flight, except only the horse, both
Persian and Boeotian. These did good service to the flying foot-men,
by advancing close to the enemy, and separating between the Greeks and
their own fugitives.</p>
<p id="passage-86"><a href="#passage-86" class="passage-id">86</a> The victors however pressed on, pursuing and slaying the remnant
of the king's army.</p>
<p id="passage-87"><a href="#passage-87" class="passage-id">87</a> Meantime, while the flight continued, tidings reached the Greeks
who were drawn up round the Heraeum, and so were absent from the
battle, that the fight was begun, and that Pausanias was gaining the
victory. Hearing this, they rushed forward without any order, the
Corinthians taking the upper road across the skirts of Cithaeron and
the hills, which led straight to the temple of Ceres; while the
Megarians and Phliasians followed the level route through the plain.
These last had almost reached the enemy, when the Theban horse
espied them, and, observing their disarray, despatched against them
the squadron of which Asopodorus, the son of Timander, was captain.
Asopodorus charged them with such effect that the left six hundred
of their number dead upon the plain, and, pursuing the rest, compelled
them to seek shelter in Cithaeron. So these men perished without
honour.</p>
<p id="passage-88"><a href="#passage-88" class="passage-id">88</a> The Persians, and the multitude with them, who fled to the
wooden fortress, were able to ascend into the towers before the
Lacedaemonians came up. Thus placed, they proceeded to strengthen
the defences as well as they could; and when the Lacedaemonians
arrived, a sharp fight took place at the rampart. So long as the
Athenians were away, the barbarians kept off their assailants, and had
much the best of the combat, since the Lacedaemonians were unskilled
in the attack of walled places: but on the arrival of the Athenians, a
more violent assault was made, and the wall was for a long time
attacked with fury. In the end the valour of the Athenians and their
perseverance prevailed- they gained the top of the wall, and, breaking
a breach through it, enabled the Greeks to pour in. The first to enter
here were the Tegeans, and they it was who plundered the tent of
Mardonius; where among other booty the found the manger from which his
horses ate, all made of solid brass, and well worth looking at. This
manger was given by the Tegeans to the temple of Minerva Alea, while
the remainder of their booty was brought into the common stock of
the Greeks. As soon as the wall was broken down, the barbarians no
longer kept together in any array, nor was there one among them who
thought of making further resistance- in good truth, they were all
half dead with fright, huddled as so many thousands were into so
narrow and confined a space. With such tameness did they submit to
be slaughtered by the Greeks, that of the 300,000 men who composed the
army- omitting the 40,000 by whom Artabazus was accompanied in his
flight- no more than 3000 outlived the battle. Of the Lacedaemonians
from Sparta there perished in this combat ninety-one; of the
Tegeans, sixteen; of the Athenians, fifty-two.</p>
<p id="passage-89"><a href="#passage-89" class="passage-id">89</a> On the side of the barbarians, the greatest courage was
manifested, among the foot-soldiers, by the Persians; among the horse,
by the Sacae; while Mardonius himself, as a man, bore off the palm
from the rest. Among the Greeks, the Athenians and the Tegeans
fought well; but the prowess shown by the Lacedaemonians was beyond
either. Of this I have but one proof to offer- since all the three
nations overthrew the force opposed to them- and that is, that the
Lacedaemonians fought and conquered the best troops. The bravest man
by far on that day was, in my judgment, Aristodemus- the same who
alone escaped from the slaughter of the three hundred at
Thermopylae, and who on that account had endured disgrace and
reproach: next to him were Posidonius, Philocyon, and Amompharetus the
Spartan. The Spartans, however, who took part in the fight, when the
question of "who had distinguished himself most," came to be talked
over among them, decided- "that Aristodemus, who, on account of the
blame which attached to him, had manifestly courted death, and had
therefore left his place in the line and behaved like a madman, had
done of a truth very notable deeds; but that Posidonius, who, with
no such desire to lose his life, had quitted himself no less
gallantly, was by so much a braver man than he." Perchance, however,
it was envy that made them speak after this sort. Of those whom I have
named above as slain in this battle, all, save and except Aristodemus,
received public honours: Aristodemus alone had no honours, because
he courted death for the reason which I have mentioned.</p>
<p id="passage-90"><a href="#passage-90" class="passage-id">90</a> These then were the most distinguished of those who fought at
Plataea. As for Callicrates,- the most beautiful man, not among the
Spartans only, but in the whole Greek camp,- he was not killed in
the battle; for it was while Pausanias was still consulting the
victims, that as he sat in his proper place in the line, an arrow
struck him on the side. While his comrades advanced to the fight, he
was borne out of the ranks, very loath to die, as he showed by the
words which he addressed to Arimnestus, one of the Plataeans;- "I
grieve," said he, "not because I have to die for my country, but
because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy, nor done any
deed worthy of me, much as I have desired to achieve something."</p>
<p id="passage-91"><a href="#passage-91" class="passage-id">91</a> The Athenian who is said to have distinguished himself the most
was Sophanes, the son of Eutychides, of the Deceleian canton. The
men of this canton, once upon a time, did a deed, which (as the
Athenians themselves confess) has ever since been serviceable to them.
When the Tyndaridae, in days of yore, invaded Attica with a mighty
army to recover Helen, and, not being able to find out whither she had
been carried, desolated the cantons,- at this time, they say, the
Deceleians (or Decelus himself, according to some), displeased at
the rudeness of Theseus, and fearing that the whole territory would
suffer, discovered everything to the enemy, and even showed them the
way to Aphidnae, which Titacus, a native of the place, betrayed into
their hands. As a reward for this action, Sparta has always, from that
time to the present, allowed the Deceleians to be free from all
dues, and to have seats of honour at their festivals; and hence too,
in the war which took place many years after these events between
the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, the Lacedaemonians, while they
laid waste all the rest of Attica, spared the lands of the Deceleians.</p>
<p id="passage-92"><a href="#passage-92" class="passage-id">92</a> Of this canton was Sophanes, the Athenian, who most
distinguished himself in the battle. Two stories are told concerning
him: according to the one, he wore an iron anchor, fastened to the
belt which secured his breastplate by a brazen chain; and this, when
he came near the enemy, he threw out; to the intent that, when they
made their charge, it might be impossible for him to be driven from
his post: as soon, however, as the enemy fled, his wont was to take up
his anchor and join the pursuit. Such, then, is one of the said
stories. The other, which is contradictory to the first, relates
that Sophanes, instead of having an iron anchor fastened to his
breastplate, bore the device of an anchor upon his shield, which he
never allowed to rest, but made to run round continually.</p>
<p id="passage-93"><a href="#passage-93" class="passage-id">93</a> Another glorious deed was likewise performed by this same Sophanes
At the time when the Athenians were laying siege to Egina, he took
up the challenge of Eurybates the Argive, a winner of the
Pentathlum, and slew him. The fate of Sophanes in after times was
the following: he was leader of an Athenian army in conjunction with
Leagrus, the son of Glaucon, and in a battle with the Edonians near
Datum, about the gold-mines there, he was slain, after displaying
uncommon bravery.</p>
<p id="passage-94"><a href="#passage-94" class="passage-id">94</a> As soon as the Greeks at Plataea had overthrown the barbarians,
a woman came over to them from the enemy. She was one of the
concubines of Pharandates, the son of Teaspes, a Persian; and when she
heard that the Persians were all slain and that the Greeks had carried
the day, forthwith she adorned herself and her maids with many
golden ornaments, and with the bravest of the apparel that she had
brought with her, and, alighting from her litter, came forward to
the Lacedaemonians, ere the work of slaughter was well over. When
she saw that all the orders were given by Pausanias, with whose name
and country she was well acquainted, as she had oftentimes heard
tell of them, she knew who he must be; wherefore she embraced his
knees, and said-</p>
<p id="passage-95"><a href="#passage-95" class="passage-id">95</a> "O king of Sparta! save thy suppliant from the slavery that awaits
the captive. Already I am beholden to thee for one service- the
slaughter of these men, wretches who had no regard either for gods
or angels. I am by birth a Coan, the daughter of Hegetoridas, son of
Antagoras. The Persian seized me by force in Cos, and kept me
against my will."</p>
<p id="passage-96"><a href="#passage-96" class="passage-id">96</a> "Lady," answered Pausanias, "fear nothing: as a suppliant thou art
safe- and still more, if thou hast spoken truth, and Hegetoridas of
Cos is thy father- for he is bound to me by closer ties of
friendship than any other man in those regions."</p>
<p id="passage-97"><a href="#passage-97" class="passage-id">97</a> When he had thus spoken, Pausanias placed the woman in the
charge of some of the Ephors who were present, and afterwards sent her
to Egina, whither she had a desire to go.</p>
<p id="passage-98"><a href="#passage-98" class="passage-id">98</a> About the time of this woman's coming, the Mantineans arrived upon
the field, and found that all was over, and that it was too late to
take any part in the battle. Greatly distressed hereat, they
declared themselves to deserve a fine, as laggarts; after which,
learning that a portion of the Medes had fled away under Artabazus,
they were anxious to go after them as far as Thessaly. The
Lacedaemonians however would not suffer the pursuit; so they
returned again to their own land, and sent the leaders of their army
into banishment. Soon after the Mantineans, the Eleans likewise
arrived, and showed the same sorrow; after which they too returned
home, and banished their leaders. But enough concerning these nations.</p>
<p id="passage-99"><a href="#passage-99" class="passage-id">99</a> There was a man at Plataea among the troops of the Eginetans,
whose name was Lampon; he was the son of Pythias, and a person of
the first rank among his countrymen. Now this Lampon went about this
same time to Pausanias, and counselled him to do a deed of exceeding
wickedness. "Son of Cleombrotus," he said very earnestly, "what thou
hast already done is passing great and glorious. By the favour of
Heaven thou hast saved Greece, and gained a renown beyond all the
Greeks of whom we have any knowledge. Now then so finish thy work,
that thine own fame may be increased thereby, and that henceforth
barbarians may fear to commit outrages on the Grecians. When
Leonidas was slain at Thermopylae, Xerxes and Mardonius commanded that
he should be beheaded and crucified. Do thou the like at this time
by Mardonius, and thou wilt have glory in Sparta, and likewise through
the whole of Greece. For, by hanging him upon a cross, thou wilt
avenge Leonidas, who was thy father's brother."</p>
<p id="passage-100"><a href="#passage-100" class="passage-id">100</a> Thus spake Lampon, thinking to please Pausanias; but Pausanias
answered him- "My Eginetan friend, for thy foresight and thy
friendliness I am much beholden to thee: but the counsel which thou
hast offered is not good. First hast thou lifted me up to the skies,
by thy praise of my country and my achievement; and then thou hast
cast me down to the ground, by bidding me maltreat the dead, and
saying that thus I shall raise myself in men's esteem. Such doings
befit barbarians rather than Greeks; and even in barbarians we
detest them. On such terms then I could not wish to please the
Eginetans, nor those who think as they think enough for me to gain the
approval of my own countrymen, by righteous deeds as well as by
righteous words. Leonidas, whom thou wouldst have me avenge, is, I
maintain, abundantly avenged already. Surely the countless lives
here taken are enough to avenge not him only, but all those who fell
at Thermopylae. Come not thou before me again with such a speech,
nor with such counsel; and thank my forbearance that thou art not
now punished." Then Lampon, having received this answer, departed, and
went his way.</p>
<p id="passage-101"><a href="#passage-101" class="passage-id">101</a> After this Pausanias caused proclamation to be made, that no one
should lay hands on the booty, but that the Helots should collect it
and bring it all to one place. So the Helots went and spread
themselves through the camp, wherein were found many tents richly
adorned with furniture of gold and silver, many couches covered with
plates of the same, and many golden bowls, goblets, and other
drinking-vessels. On the carriages were bags containing silver and
golden kettles; and the bodies of the slain furnished bracelets and
chains, and scymitars with golden ornaments- not to mention
embroidered apparel, of which no one made any account. The Helots at
this time stole many things of much value, which they sold in after
times to the Eginetans; however, they brought in likewise no small
quantity, chiefly such things as it was not possible for them to hide.
And this was the beginning of the great wealth of the Eginetans, who
bought the gold of the Helots as if it had been mere brass.</p>
<p id="passage-102"><a href="#passage-102" class="passage-id">102</a> When all the booty had been brought together, a tenth of the whole
was set apart for the Delphian god; and hence was made the golden
tripod which stands on the bronze serpent with the three heads,
quite close to the altar. Portions were also set apart for the gods of
Olympia, and of the Isthmus; from which were made, in the one case,
a bronze Jupiter ten cubits high; and in the other, a bronze Neptune
of seven cubits. After this, the rest of the spoil was divided among
the soldiers, each of whom received less or more according to his
deserts; and in this way was a distribution made of the Persian
concubines, of the gold, the silver, the beasts of burthen, and all
the other valuables. What special gifts were presented to those who
had most distinguished themselves in the battle, I do not find
mentioned by any one; but I should suppose that they must have had
some gifts beyond the others. As for Pausanias, the portion which
was set apart for him consisted of ten specimens of each kind of
thing- women, horses, talents, camels, or whatever else there was in
the spoil.</p>
<p id="passage-103"><a href="#passage-103" class="passage-id">103</a> It is said that the following circumstance happened likewise at
this time. Xerxes, when he fled away out of Greece, left his
war-tent with Mardonius: when Pausanias, therefore, saw the tent
with its adornments of gold and silver, and its hangings of divers
colours, he gave commandment to the bakers and the cooks to make him
ready a banquet in such fashion as was their wont for Mardonius.
Then they made ready as they were bidden; and Pausanius, beholding the
couches of gold and silver daintily decked out with their rich
covertures, and the tables of gold and silver laid, and the feast
itself prepared with all magnificence, was astonished at the good
things which were set before him, and, being in a pleasant mood,
gave commandment to his own followers to make ready a Spartan
supper. When the suppers were both served, and it was apparent how
vast a difference lay between the two, Pausanias laughed, and sent his
servants to call to him the Greek generals. On their coming, he
pointed to the two boards, and said:-</p>
<p id="passage-104"><a href="#passage-104" class="passage-id">104</a> "I sent for you, O Greeks, to show you the folly of this Median
captain, who, when he enjoyed such fare as this, must needs come
here to rob us of our penury."</p>
<p id="passage-105"><a href="#passage-105" class="passage-id">105</a> Such, it is said, were the words of Pausanias to the Grecian
generals.</p>
<p id="passage-106"><a href="#passage-106" class="passage-id">106</a> During many years afterwards, the Plataeans used often to find
upon the field of battle concealed treasures of gold, and silver,
and other valuables. More recently they likewise made discovery of the
following: the flesh having all fallen away from the bodies of the
dead, and their bones having been gathered together into one place,
the Plataeans found a skull without any seam, made entirely of a
single bone; likewise a jaw, both the upper bone and the under,
wherein all the teeth, front and back, were joined together and made
of one bone; also, the skeleton of a man not less than five cubits
in height.</p>
<p id="passage-107"><a href="#passage-107" class="passage-id">107</a> The body of Mardonius disappeared the day after the battle; but
who it was that stole it away I cannot say with certainty. I have
heard tell of a number of persons, and those too of many different
nations, who are said to have given him burial; and I know that many
have received large sums on this score from Artontes the son of
Mardonius: but I cannot discover with any certainty which of them it
was who really took the body away, and buried it. Among others,
Dionysophanes, an Ephesian, is rumoured to have been the actual
person.</p>
<p id="passage-108"><a href="#passage-108" class="passage-id">108</a> The Greeks, after sharing the booty upon the field of Plataea,
proceeded to bury their own dead, each nation apart from the rest. The
Lacedaemonians made three graves; in one they buried their youths,
among whom were Posidonius, Amompharetus, Philocyon, and Callicrates;-
in another, the rest of the Spartans; and in the third, the Helots.
Such was their mode of burial. The Tegeans buried all their dead in
a single grave; as likewise did the Athenians theirs, and the
Megarians and Phliasians those who were slain by the horse. These
graves, then, had bodies buried in them: as for the other tombs
which are to be seen at Plataea, they were raised, as I understand, by
the Greeks whose troops took no part in the battle; and who, being
ashamed of themselves, erected empty barrows upon the field, to obtain
credit with those who should come after them. Among others, the
Eginetans have a grave there, which goes by their name; but which,
as I learn, was made ten years later by Cleades, the son of Autodicus,
a Plataean, at the request of the Eginetans, whose. agent he was.</p>
<p id="passage-109"><a href="#passage-109" class="passage-id">109</a> After the Greeks had buried their dead at Plataea,' they presently
held a council, whereat it was resolved to make war upon Thebes, and
to require that those who had joined the Medes should be delivered
into their hands. Two men, who had been the chief leaders on the
occasion, were especially named- to wit, Timagenidas and Attaginus. If
the Thebans should refuse to give these men up, it was determined to
lay siege to their city, and never stir from before it till it
should surrender. After this resolve, the army marched upon Thebes;
and having demanded the men, and been refused, began the siege, laying
waste the country all around, and making assaults upon the wall in
divers places.</p>
<p id="passage-110"><a href="#passage-110" class="passage-id">110</a> When twenty days were gone by, and the violence of the Greeks
did not slacken, Timagenidas thus bespake his countrymen-</p>
<p id="passage-111"><a href="#passage-111" class="passage-id">111</a> "Ye men of Thebes, since the Greeks have so decreed, that they
will never desist from the siege till either they take Thebes or we
are delivered to them, we would not that the land of Boeotia should
suffer any longer on our behalf. If it be money that they in truth
desire, and their demand of us be no more than a pretext, let money
from the treasury of the state be given them; for the state, and not
we alone, embraced the cause of the Medes. If, however, they really
want our persons, and on that account press this siege, we are ready
to be delivered to them and to stand our trial."</p>
<p id="passage-112"><a href="#passage-112" class="passage-id">112</a> The Thebans thought this offer very right and seasonable;
wherefore, they despatched a herald without any delay to Pausanias,
and told him they were willing to deliver up the men.</p>
<p id="passage-113"><a href="#passage-113" class="passage-id">113</a> As soon as an agreement had been concluded upon these terms,
Attaginus made his escape from the city; his sons, however, were
surrendered in his place; but Pausanias refused to hold them guilty,
since children (he said) could have had part in such an offence. The
rest of those whom the Thebans gave up had expected to obtain a trial,
and in that case their trust was to escape by means of bribery; but
Pausanias, afraid of this, dismissed at once the whole army of allies,
and took the men with him to Corinth, where he slew them all. Such
were the events which happened at Plataea and at Thebes.</p>
<p id="passage-114"><a href="#passage-114" class="passage-id">114</a> Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, who fled away from Plataea, was
soon far sped on his journey. When he reached Thessaly, the
inhabitants received him hospitably, and made inquiries of him
concerning the rest of the army, since they were still altogether
ignorant of what had taken place at Plataea: whereupon the Persian,
knowing well that, if he told them the truth, he would run great
risk of perishing himself, together with his whole army- for if the
facts were once blazoned abroad, all who learnt them would be sure
to fall upon him- the Persian, I say, considering this, as he had
before kept all secret from the Phocians, so now answered the
Thessalians after the following fashion:-</p>
<p id="passage-115"><a href="#passage-115" class="passage-id">115</a> "I myself, Thessalians, am hastening, as ye see, into Thrace;
and I am fain to use all possible despatch, as I am sent with this
force on special business from the main army. Mardonius and his host
are close behind me, and may be looked for shortly. When he comes,
receive him as ye have received me, and show him every kindness. Be
sure ye will never hereafter regret it, if ye so do."</p>
<p id="passage-116"><a href="#passage-116" class="passage-id">116</a> With these words he took his departure, and marched his troops
at their best speed through Thessaly and Macedon straight upon Thrace,
following the inland route, which was the shortest, and, in good
truth, using all possible dispatch. He himself succeeded in reaching
Byzantium; but a great part of his army perished upon the road- many
being cut to pieces by the Thracians, and others dying from hunger and
excess of toil. From Byzantium Artabazus set sail, and crossed the
strait; returning into Asia in the manner which has been here
described.</p>
<p id="passage-117"><a href="#passage-117" class="passage-id">117</a> On the same day that the blow was struck at Plataea, another
defeat befell the Persians at Mycale in Ionia. While the Greek fleet
under Leotychides the Lacedaemonian was still lying inactive at Delos,
there arrived at that place an embassy from Samos, consisting of three
men, Lampon the son of Thrasycles, Athenagoras the son of
Archestratidas, and Hegesistratus the son of Aristagoras. The
Samians had sent them secretly, concealing their departure both from
the Persians and from their own tyrant Theomestor, the son of
Androdamas, whom the Persians had made ruler of Samos. When the
ambassadors came before the Greek captains Hegesistratus took the
word, and urged them with many and various arguments, saying, "that
the Ionians only needed to see them arrive in order to revolt from the
Persians; and that the Persians would never abide their coming; or
if they did, 'twould be to offer them the finest booty that they could
anywhere expect to gain;" while at the same time he made appeal to the
gods of their common worship, and besought them to deliver from
bondage a Grecian race, and withal to drive back the barbarians.
"This," he said, "might very easily be done, for the Persian ships
were bad sailers, and far from a match for theirs;" adding,
moreover, "that if there was any suspicion lest the Samians intended
to deal treacherously, they were themselves ready to become
hostages, and to return on board the ships of their allies to Asia."</p>
<p id="passage-118"><a href="#passage-118" class="passage-id">118</a> When the Samian stranger continued importunately beseeching him,
Leotychides, either because he wanted an omen, or by a mere chance, as
God guided him, asked the man- "Samian stranger! prithee, tell me
thy name?" "Hegesistratus (army-leader)," answered the other, and
might have said more, but Leotychides stopped him by exclaiming- "I
accept, O Samian! the omen which thy name affords. Only, before thou
goest back, swear to us, thyself and thy brother-envoys, that the
Samians will indeed be our warm, friends and allies."</p>
<p id="passage-119"><a href="#passage-119" class="passage-id">119</a> No sooner had he thus spoken than he proceeded to hurry forward
the business. The Samians pledged their faith upon the spot; and oaths
of alliance were exchanged between them and the Greeks. This done, two
of the ambassadors forthwith sailed away; as for Hegesistratus,
Leotychides kept him to accompany his own fleet, for he considered his
name to be a good omen. The Greeks abode where they were that day, and
on the morrow sacrificed, and found the victims favourable. Their
soothsayer was Deiphonus, the son of Evenius, a man of Apollonia- I
mean the Apollonia which lies upon the Ionian Gulf.</p>
<p id="passage-120"><a href="#passage-120" class="passage-id">120</a> A strange thing happened to this man's father, Evenius. The
Apolloniats have a flock of sheep sacred to the sun. During the
daytime these sheep graze along the banks of the river which flows
from Mount Lacmon through their territory and empties itself into
the sea by the port of Oricus; while at night they are guarded by
the richest and noblest of the citizens, who are chosen to serve the
office, and who keep the watch each for one year. Now the
Apolloniats set great store by these sheep, on account of an oracle
which they received concerning them. The place where they are folded
at night is a cavern, a long way from the town. Here it happened
that Evenius, when he was chosen to keep the watch, by some accident
fell asleep upon his guard; and while he slept, the cave was entered
by wolves, which destroyed some sixty of the flock under his care.
Evenius, when he woke and found what had occurred, kept silence
about it and told no one; for he thought to buy other sheep and put
them in the place of the slain. But the matter came to the ears of the
Apolloniats, who forthwith brought Evenius to trial, and condemned him
to lose his eyes, because he had gone to sleep upon his post. Now when
Evenius was blinded, straightway the sheep had no young, and the
land ceased to bear its wonted harvests. Then the Apolloniats sent
to Dodona, and to Delphi, and asked the prophets, what had caused
the woes which so afflicted them. The answer which they received was
this- "The woes were come for Evenius, the guardian of the sacred
sheep, whom the Apolloniats had wrongfully deprived of sight. They
(the gods) had themselves sent the wolves; nor would they ever cease
to exact vengeance for Evenius, till the Apolloniats made him whatever
atonement he liked to ask. When this was paid, they would likewise
give him a gift, which would make many men call him blessed."</p>
<p id="passage-121"><a href="#passage-121" class="passage-id">121</a> Such was the tenor of the prophecies. The Apolloniats kept them
close, but charged some of their citizens to go and make terms with
Evenius; and these men managed the business for them in the way
which I will now describe. They found Evenius upon a bench, and,
approaching him, they sat down by his side, and began to talk: at
first they spoke of quite other matters, but in the end they mentioned
his misfortune, and offered him their condolence. Having thus beguiled
him, at last they put the question- "What atonement would he desire,
if the Apolloniats were willing to make him satisfaction for the wrong
which they had done to him?" Hereupon Evenius, who had not heard of
the oracle, made answer- "If I were given the lands of this man and
that-" (here he named the two men whom he knew to have the finest
farms in Apollonia), "and likewise the house of this other"- (and here
he mentioned the house which he knew to be the handsomest in the
town), "I would, when master of these, be quite content, and my
wrath would cease altogether." As soon as Evenius had thus spoken, the
men who sat by him rejoined- "Evenius, the Apolloniats give thee the
atonement which thou hast desired, according to the bidding of the
oracles." Then Evenius understood the whole matter, and was enraged
that they had deceived him so; but the Apolloniats bought the farms
from their owners, and gave Evenius what he had chosen. After this was
done, straightway Evenius had the gift of prophecy, insomuch that he
became a famous man in Greece.</p>
<p id="passage-122"><a href="#passage-122" class="passage-id">122</a> Deiphonus, the son of this Evenius, had accompanied the
Corinthians, and was soothsayer, as I said before, to the Greek
armament. One account, however, which I have heard, declares that he
was not really the son of this man, but only took the name, and then
went about Greece and let out his services for hire.</p>
<p id="passage-123"><a href="#passage-123" class="passage-id">123</a> The Greeks, as soon as the victims were favourable, put to sea,
and sailed across from Delos to Samos. Arriving off Calami, a place
upon the Samian coast, they brought the fleet to an anchor near the
temple of Juno which stands there, and prepared to engage the Persians
by sea. These latter, however, no sooner heard of the approach of
the Greeks, than, dismissing the Phoenician ships, they sailed away
with the remainder to the mainland. For it had been resolved in
council not to risk a battle, since the Persian fleet was thought to
be no match for that of the enemy. They fled, therefore, to the
main, to be under the protection of their land army, which now lay
at Mycale, and consisted of the troops left behind by Xerxes to keep
guard over Ionia. This was an army of sixty thousand men, under the
command of Tigranes, a Persian of more than common beauty and stature.
The captains resolved therefore to betake themselves to these troops
for defence, to drag their ships ashore, and to build a rampart around
them, which might at once protect the fleet, and serve likewise as a
place of refuge for themselves.</p>
<p id="passage-124"><a href="#passage-124" class="passage-id">124</a> Having so resolved, the commanders put out to sea; and passing the
temple of the Eumenides, arrived at Gaeson and Scolopoeis, which are
in the territory of Mycale. Here is a temple of Eleusinian Ceres,
built by Philistus the son of Pasicles who came to Asia with Neileus
the son of Codrus, what time he founded Miletus. At this place they
drew the ships up on the beach, and surrounded them with a rampart
made of stones and trunks of trees, cutting down for this purpose
all the fruit-trees which grew near, and defending the barrier by
means of stakes firmly planted in the ground. Here they were
prepared either to win a battle, or undergo a siege- their thoughts
embracing both chances.</p>
<p id="passage-125"><a href="#passage-125" class="passage-id">125</a> The Greeks, when they understood that the barbarians had fled to
the mainland, were sorely vexed at their escape: nor could they
determine at first what they should do, whether they should return
home, or proceed to the Hellespont. In the end, however, they resolved
to do neither, but to make sail for the continent. So they made
themselves ready for a sea-fight by the preparation of
boarding-bridges, and what else was necessary; provided with which
they sailed to Mycale. Now when they came to the place where the
camp was, they found no one venture out to meet them, but observed the
ships all dragged ashore within the barrier, and a strong land-force
drawn up in battle array upon the beach; Leotychides therefore
sailed along the shore in his ship, keeping as close hauled to the
land as possible, and by the voice of a herald thus addressed the
Ionians:-</p>
<p id="passage-126"><a href="#passage-126" class="passage-id">126</a> "Men of Ionia- ye who can hear me speak- do ye take heed to what I
say; for the Persians will not understand a word that I utter. When we
join battle with them, before aught else, remember Freedom- and
next, recollect our watchword, which is Hebe. If there be any who hear
me not, let those who hear report my words to the others."</p>
<p id="passage-127"><a href="#passage-127" class="passage-id">127</a> In all this Leotychides had the very same design which
Themistocles entertained at Artemisium. Either the barbarians would
not know what he had said, and the Ionians would be persuaded to
revolt from them; or if his words were reported to the former, they
would mistrust their Greek soldiers.</p>
<p id="passage-128"><a href="#passage-128" class="passage-id">128</a> After Leotychides had made this address, the Greeks brought
their ships to the land, and, having disembarked, arrayed themselves
for the battle. When the Persians saw them marshalling their array,
and bethought themselves of the advice which had been offered to the
Ionians, their first act was to disarm the Samians, whom they
suspected of complicity with the enemy. For it had happened lately
that a number of the Athenians who lingered in Attica, having been
made prisoners by the troops of Xerxes, were brought to Asia on
board the barbarian fleet; and these men had been ransomed, one and
all, by the Samians, who sent them back to Athens, well furnished with
provisions for the way. On this account, as much as on any other,
the Samians were suspected, as men who had paid the ransom of five
hundred of the king's enemies. After disarming them, the Persians next
despatched the Milesians to guard the paths which lead up into the
heights of Mycale, because (they said) the Milesians were well
acquainted with that region: their true object, however, was to remove
them to a distance from the camp. In this way the Persians sought to
secure themselves against such of the Ionians as they thought
likely, if occasion offered, to make rebellion. They then joined
shield to shield, and so made themselves a breastwork against the
enemy.</p>
<p id="passage-129"><a href="#passage-129" class="passage-id">129</a> The Greeks now, having finished their preparations, began to
move towards the barbarians; when, lo! as they advanced, a rumour flew
through the host from one end to the other- that the Greeks had fought
and conquered the army of Mardonius in Boeotia. At the same time a
herald's wand was observed lying upon the beach. Many things prove
to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man. How else, when
the battles of Mycale and Plataea were about to happen on the self
same day, should such a rumour have reached the Greeks in that region,
greatly cheering the whole army, and making them more eager than
before to risk their lives.</p>
<p id="passage-130"><a href="#passage-130" class="passage-id">130</a> A strange coincidence too it was, that both the battles should
have been fought near a precinct of Eleusinian Ceres. The fight at
Plataea took place, as I said before, quite close to one of Ceres'
temples; and now the battle at Mycale was to be fought hard by
another. Rightly, too, did the rumour run, that the Greeks with
Pausanias had gained their victory; for the fight at Plataea fell
early in the day, whereas that at Mycale was towards evening. That the
two battles were really fought on the same day of the same month
became apparent when inquiries were made a short time afterwards.
Before the rumour reached them, the Greeks were full of fear, not so
much on their own account, as for their countrymen, and for Greece
herself, lest she should be worsted in her struggle with Mardonius.
But when the voice fell on them, their fear vanished, and they charged
more vigorously and at a quicker pace. So the Greeks and the
barbarians rushed with like eagerness to the fray; for the
Hellespont and the Islands formed the prize for which they were
about to fight.</p>
<p id="passage-131"><a href="#passage-131" class="passage-id">131</a> The Athenians, and the force drawn up with them, who formed one
half of the army, marched along the shore, where the country was low
and level; but the way for the Lacedaemonians and the troops with
them, lay across hills and a torrent-course. Hence, while the
Lacedaemonians were effecting their their passage round, the Athenians
on the other wing had already closed with the enemy. So long as the
wicker bucklers of the Persians continued standing, they made a
stout defence, and had not even the worst of the battle; but when
the Athenians, and the allies with them, wishing to make the victory
their own, and not share it with the Lacedaemonians, cheered each
other on with shouts, and attacked them with the utmost fierceness,
then at last the face of things became changed. For, bursting
through the line of shields, and rushing forwards in a body, the
Greeks fell upon the Persians; who, though they bore the charge and
for a long time maintained their ground, yet at length took refuge
in their intrenchment. Here the Athenians themselves, together with
those who followed them in the line of battle, the Corinthians, the
Sicyonians, and the Troezenians, pressed so closely on the steps of
their flying foes, that they entered along with them into the
fortress. And now, when even their fortress was taken, the
barbarians no longer offered resistance, but fled hastily away, all
save only the Persians. They still continued to fight in knots of a
few men against the Greeks, who kept pouring into the intrenchment.
And here, while two of the Persian commanders fled, two fell upon
the field: Artayntes and Ithamitres, who were leaders of the fleet,
escaped; Mardontes, and the commander of the land force, Tigranes,
died fighting.</p>
<p id="passage-132"><a href="#passage-132" class="passage-id">132</a> The Persians still held out, when the Lacedaemonians, and their
part of the army, reached the camp, and joined in the remainder of the
battle. The number of Greeks who fell in the struggle here was not
small; the Sicyonians especially lost many, and, among the rest,
Perilaus their general.</p>
<p id="passage-133"><a href="#passage-133" class="passage-id">133</a> The Samians, who served with the Medes, and who, although
disarmed, still remained in the camp, seeing from the very beginning
of the fight that the victory was doubtful, did all that lay in
their power to render help to the Greeks. And the other Ionians
likewise, beholding their example, revolted and attacked the Persians.</p>
<p id="passage-134"><a href="#passage-134" class="passage-id">134</a> As for the Milesians, who had been ordered, for the better
security of the Persians, to guard the mountain-paths,- that in case
any accident befell them such as had now happened, they might not lack
guides to conduct them into the high tracts of Mycale,- and who had
also been removed to hinder them from making an outbreak in the
Persian camp; they, instead of obeying their orders, broke them in
every respect. For they guided the flying Persians by wrong roads,
which brought them into the presence of the enemy; and at last they
set upon them with their own hands, and showed themselves the
hottest of their adversaries. Ionia, therefore, on this day revolted a
second time from the Persians.</p>
<p id="passage-135"><a href="#passage-135" class="passage-id">135</a> In this battle the Greeks who behaved with the greatest bravery
were the Athenians; and among them the palm was borne off by
Hermolycus, the son of Euthynus, a man accomplished in the Pancratium.
This Hermolycus was afterwards slain in the war between the
Athenians and Carystians. He fell in the fight near Cyrnus in the
Carystian territory, and was buried in the neighbourhood of Geraestus.
After the Athenians, the most distinguished on the Greek side were the
Corinthians, the Troezenians, and the Sicyonians.</p>
<p id="passage-136"><a href="#passage-136" class="passage-id">136</a> The Greeks, when they had slaughtered the greater portion of the
barbarians, either in the battle or in the rout, set fire to their
ships and burnt them, together with the bulwark which had been
raised for their defence, first however removing therefrom all the
booty, and carrying it down to the beach. Besides other plunder,
they found here many caskets of money. When they had burnt the rampart
and the vessels, the Greeks sailed away to Samos, and there took
counsel together concerning the Ionians, whom they thought of removing
out of Asia. Ionia they proposed to abandon to the barbarians; and
their doubt was, in what part of their own possessions in Greece
they should settle its inhabitants. For it seemed to them a thing
impossible that they should be ever on the watch to guard and
protect Ionia; and yet otherwise there could be no hope that the
Ionians would escape the vengeance of the Persians. Hereupon the
Peloponnesian leaders proposed that the seaport towns of such Greeks
as had sided with the Medes should be taken away from them, and made
over to the Ionians. The Athenians, on the other hand, were very
unwilling that any removal at all should take place, and disliked
the Peloponnesians holding councils concerning their colonists. So, as
they set themselves against the change, the Peloponnesians yielded
with a good will. Hereupon the Samians, Chians, Lesbians, and other
islanders, who had helped the Greeks at this time, were received
into the league of the allies; and took the oaths, binding
themselves to be faithful, and not desert the common cause. Then the
Greeks sailed away to the Hellespont, where they meant to break down
the bridges, which they supposed to be still extended across the
strait.</p>
<p id="passage-137"><a href="#passage-137" class="passage-id">137</a> The barbarians who escaped from the battle- a scanty remnant- took
refuge in the heights of Mycale, whence they made good their retreat
to Sardis. During the march, Masistes, the son of Darius, who had been
present at the disaster, had words with Artayntes, the general, on
whom he showered many reproaches. He called him, among other things,
"worse than a woman," for the way in which he had exercised his
command, and said there was no punishment which he did not deserve
to suffer for doing the king's house such grievous hurt. Now with
the Persians there is no greater insult than to call a man "worse than
a woman." So when Artayntes had borne the reproaches for some while,
at last he fell in a rage, and drew his scymitar upon Masistes,
being fain to kill him. But a certain Halicarnassian, Xenagoras by
name, the son of Praxilaus, who stood behind Artayntes at the time,
seeing him in the act of rushing forward, seized him suddenly round
the waist, and, lifting him from his feet, dashed him down upon the
ground; which gave time for the spearmen who guarded Masistes to
come to his aid. By his conduct here Xenagoras gained the favour,
not of Masistes only, but likewise of Xerxes himself, whose brother he
had preserved from death; and the king rewarded his action by
setting him over the whole land of Cilicia. Except this, nothing
happened upon the road; and the men continued their march and came all
safe to Sardis. At Sardis they found the king, who had been there ever
since he lost the sea-fight and fled from Athens to Asia.</p>
<p id="passage-138"><a href="#passage-138" class="passage-id">138</a> During the time that Xerxes abode at this place, he fell in love
with the wife of Masistes, who was likewise staying in the city. He
therefore sent her messages, but failed to win her consent; and he
could not dare to use violence, out of regard to Masistes, his
brother. This the woman knew well enough, and hence it was that she
had the boldness to resist him. So Xerxes, finding no other way
open, devised a marriage between his own son Darius and a daughter
of this woman and Masistes- thinking that he might better obtain his
ends if he effected this union. Accordingly he betrothed these two
persons to one another, and, after the usual ceremonies were
completed, took his departure for Susa. When he was come there, and
had received the woman into his palace as his son's bride, a change
came over him, and losing all love for the wife of Masistes, he
conceived a passion for his son's bride, Masistes' daughter. And
Artaynta- for so was she called- very soon returned his love.</p>
<p id="passage-139"><a href="#passage-139" class="passage-id">139</a> After a while the thing was discovered in the way which I will now
relate. Amestris, the wife of Xerxes, had woven with her own hands a
long robe, of many colours, and very curious, which she presented to
her husband as a gift. Xerxes, who was greatly pleased with it,
forthwith put it on; and went in it to visit Artaynta, who happened
likewise on this day to please him greatly. He therefore bade her
ask him whatever boon she liked, and promised that, whatever it was,
he would assuredly grant her request. Then Artaynta, who was doomed to
suffer calamity together with her whole house, said to him- "Wilt thou
indeed give me whatever I like to ask?" So the king, suspecting
nothing less than that her choice would fall where it did, pledged his
word, and swore to her. She then, as soon as she heard his oath, asked
boldly for the robe. Hereupon Xerxes tried all possible means to avoid
the gift; not that he grudged to give it, but because he dreaded
Amestris, who already suspected, and would now, he feared, detect
his love. So he offered her cities instead, and heaps of gold, and
an army which should obey no other leader. (The last of these is a
thoroughly Persian gift.) But, as nothing could prevail on Artaynta to
change her mind, at the last he gave her the robe. Then Artaynta was
very greatly rejoiced, and she often wore the garment and was proud of
it. And so it came to the ears of Amestris that the robe had been
given to her.</p>
<p id="passage-140"><a href="#passage-140" class="passage-id">140</a> Now when Amestris learnt the whole matter, she felt no anger
against Artaynta; but, looking upon her mother, the wife of
Masistes, as the cause of all the mischief, she determined to
compass her death. She waited, therefore, till her husband gave the
great royal banquet, a feast which takes place once every year, in
celebration of the king's birthday- "Tykta" the feast is called in the
Persian tongue, which in our language may be rendered "perfect"- and
this is the only day in all the year on which the king soaps his head,
and distributes gifts to the Persians. Amestris waited, accordingly,
for this day, and then made request of Xerxes, that he would please to
give her, as her present, the wife of Masistes. But he refused; for it
seemed to him shocking and monstrous to give into the power of another
a woman who was not only his brother's wife, but was likewise wholly
guiltless of what had happened- the more especially as he knew well
enough with what intent Amestris had preferred her request.</p>
<p id="passage-141"><a href="#passage-141" class="passage-id">141</a> At length, however, wearied by her importunity, and constrained
moreover by the law of the feast, which required that no one who asked
a boon that day at the king's board should be denied his request, he
yielded, but with a very ill will, and gave the woman into her
power. Having so done, and told Amestris she might deal with her as
she chose, the king called his brother into his presence, and said-</p>
<p id="passage-142"><a href="#passage-142" class="passage-id">142</a> "Masistes, thou art my brother, the son of my father Darius;
and, what is more, thou art a good man. I pray thee, live no longer
with the wife whom thou now hast. Behold, I will give thee instead
my own daughter in marriage; take her to live with thee. But part
first with the wife thou now hast- I like not that thou keep to her."</p>
<p id="passage-143"><a href="#passage-143" class="passage-id">143</a> To this Masistes, greatly astonished, answered-</p>
<p id="passage-144"><a href="#passage-144" class="passage-id">144</a> "My lord and master, how strange a speech hast thou uttered!
Thou biddest me put away my wife, who has borne me three goodly
youths, and daughters besides, whereof thou hast taken one and
espoused her to a son of thine own- thou biddest me put away this
wife, notwithstanding that she pleases me greatly, and marry a
daughter of thine! In truth, O king! that I am accounted worthy to wed
thy daughter, is an honour which I mightily esteem; but yet to do as
thou sayest am I in no wise willing. I pray thee, use not force to
compel me to yield to thy prayer. Be sure thy daughter will find a
husband to the full as worthy as myself. Suffer me then to live on
with my own wife."</p>
<p id="passage-145"><a href="#passage-145" class="passage-id">145</a> Thus did Masistes answer; and Xerxes, in wrath, replied- "I will
tell thee, Masistes, what thou hast gained by these words. I will
not give thee my daughter; nor shalt thou live any longer with thy own
wife. So mayest thou learn, in time to come, to take what is offered
thee." Masistes, when he heard this, withdrew, only saying- "Master
thou hast not yet taken my life."</p>
<p id="passage-146"><a href="#passage-146" class="passage-id">146</a> While these things were passing between Xerxes and his brother
Masistes, Amestris sent for the spearmen of the royal bodyguard, and
caused the wife of Masistes to be mutilated in a horrible fashion. Her
two breasts, her nose, ears, and lips were cut off and thrown to the
dogs; her tongue was torn out by the roots, and thus disfigured she
was sent back to her home.</p>
<p id="passage-147"><a href="#passage-147" class="passage-id">147</a> Masistes, who knew nothing of what had happened, but was fearful
that some calamity had befallen him, ran hastily to his house.
There, finding his wife so savagely used, he forthwith took counsel
with his sons, and, accompanied by them and certain others also, set
forth on his way to Bactria, intending to stir up revolt in that
province, and hoping to do great hurt to Xerxes: all which, I believe,
he would have accomplished, if he had once reached the Bactrian and
Sacan people; for he was greatly beloved by them both, and was
moreover satrap of Bactria. But Xerxes, hearing of his designs, sent
an armed force upon his track, and slew him while he was still upon
the road, with his sons and his whole army. Such is the tale of King
Xerxes' love and of the death of his brother Masistes.</p>
<p id="passage-148"><a href="#passage-148" class="passage-id">148</a> Meanwhile the Greeks, who had left Mycale, and sailed for the
Hellespont, were forced by contrary winds to anchor near Lectum;
from which place they afterwards sailed on to Abydos. On arriving
here, they discovered that the bridges, which they had thought to find
standing, and which had been the chief cause of their proceeding to
the Hellespont, were already broken up and destroyed. Upon this
discovery, Leotychides, and the Peloponnesians under him, were anxious
to sail back to Greece; but the Athenians, with Xanthippus their
captain, thought good to remain, and resolved to make an attempt
upon the Chersonese. So, while the Peloponnesians sailed away to their
homes, the Athenians crossed over from Abydos to the Chersonese, and
there laid siege to Sestos.</p>
<p id="passage-149"><a href="#passage-149" class="passage-id">149</a> Now, as Sestos was the strongest fortress in all that region,
the rumour had no sooner gone forth that the Greeks were arrived at
the Hellespont, than great numbers flocked thither from all the
towns in the neighbourhood. Among the rest there came a certain
Oeobazus, a Persian, from the city of Cardia, where he had laid up the
shore-cables which had been used in the construction of the bridges.
The town was guarded by its own Aeolian inhabitants, but contained
also some Persians, and a great multitude of their allies.</p>
<p id="passage-150"><a href="#passage-150" class="passage-id">150</a> The whole district was under the rule of Artayctes, one of the
king's satraps; who was a Persian, but a wicked and cruel man. At
the time when Xerxes was marching against Athens, he had craftily
possessed himself of the treasures belonging to Protesilaus the son of
Iphiclus, which were at Elaesus in the Chersonese. For at this place
is the tomb of Protesilaus, surrounded by a sacred precinct; and
here there was great store of wealth, vases of gold and silver,
works in brass, garments, and other offerings, all which Artayctes
made his prey, having got the king's consent by thus cunningly
addressing him-</p>
<p id="passage-151"><a href="#passage-151" class="passage-id">151</a> "Master, there is in this region the house of a Greek, who, when
he attacked thy territory, met his due reward, and perished. Give me
his house, I pray thee, that hereafter men may fear to carry arms
against thy land."</p>
<p id="passage-152"><a href="#passage-152" class="passage-id">152</a> By these words he easily persuaded Xerxes to give him the man's
house; for there was no suspicion of his design in the king's mind.
And he could say in a certain sense that Protesilaus had borne arms
against the land of the king; because the Persians consider all Asia
to belong to them, and to their king for the time being. So when
Xerxes allowed his request, he brought all the treasures from
Elaesus to Sestos, and made the sacred land into cornfields and
pasture land; nay, more, whenever he paid a visit to Elaesus, he
polluted the shrine itself by vile uses. It was this Artayctes who was
now besieged by the Athenians- and he was but ill prepared for
defence; since the Greeks had fallen upon him quite unawares, nor
had he in the least expected their coming.</p>
<p id="passage-153"><a href="#passage-153" class="passage-id">153</a> When it was now late in the autumn, and the siege still continued,
the Athenians began to murmur that they were kept abroad so long; and,
seeing that they were not able to take the place, besought their
captains to lead them back to their own country. But the captains
refused to move, till either the city had fallen, or the Athenian
people ordered them to return home. So the soldiers patiently bore
up against their sufferings.</p>
<p id="passage-154"><a href="#passage-154" class="passage-id">154</a> Meanwhile those within the walls were reduced to the last straits,
and forced even to boil the very thongs of their beds for food. At
last, when these too failed them, Artayctes and Oeobazus, with the
native Persians, fled away from the place by night, having let
themselves down from the wall at the back of the town, where the
blockading force was scantiest. As soon as day dawned, they of the
Chersonese made signals to the Greeks from the walls, and let them
know what had happened, at the same time throwing open the gates of
their city. Hereupon, while some of the Greeks entered the town,
others, and those the more numerous body, set out in pursuit of the
enemy.</p>
<p id="passage-155"><a href="#passage-155" class="passage-id">155</a> Oeobazus fled into Thrace; but there the Apsinthian Thracians
seized him, and offered him, after their wonted fashion, to
Pleistorus, one of the gods of their country. His companions they
likewise put to death, but in a different manner. As for Artayctes,
and the troops with him, who had been the last to leave the town, they
were overtaken by the Greeks, not far from Aegospotami, and defended
themselves stoutly for a time, but were at last either killed or taken
prisoners. Those whom they made prisoners the Greeks bound with
chains, and brought with them to Sestos. Artayctes and his son were
among the number.</p>
<p id="passage-156"><a href="#passage-156" class="passage-id">156</a> Now the Chersonesites relate that the following prodigy befell one
of the Greeks who guarded the captives. He was broiling upon a fire
some salted fish, when of a sudden they began to leap and quiver, as
if they had been only just caught. Hereat, the rest of the guards
hurried round to look, and were greatly amazed at the sight.
Artayctes, however, beholding the prodigy, called the man to him,
and said-</p>
<p id="passage-157"><a href="#passage-157" class="passage-id">157</a> "Fear not, Athenian stranger, because of this marvel. It has not
appeared on thy account, but on mine. Protesilaus of Elaeus has sent
it to show me, that albeit he is dead and embalmed with salt, he has
power from the gods to chastise his injurer. Now then I would fain
acquit my debt to him thus. For the riches which I took from his
temple, I will fix my fine at one hundred talents- while for myself
and this boy of mine, I will give the Athenians two hundred talents,
on condition that they will spare our lives."</p>
<p id="passage-158"><a href="#passage-158" class="passage-id">158</a> Such were the promises of Artayctes; but they failed to persuade
Xanthippus. For the men of Elaeus, who wished to avenge Protesilaus,
entreated that he might be put to death; and Xanthippus himself was of
the same mind. So they led Artayctes to the tongue of land where the
bridges of Xerxes had been fixed- or, according to others, to the
knoll above the town of Madytus; and, having nailed him to a board,
they left him hanging thereupon. As for the son of Artayctes, him they
stoned to death before his eyes.</p>
<p id="passage-159"><a href="#passage-159" class="passage-id">159</a> This done, they sailed back to Greece, carrying with them, besides
other treasures, the shore cables from the bridges of Xerxes, which
they wished to dedicate in their temples. And this was all that took
place that year.</p>
<p id="passage-160"><a href="#passage-160" class="passage-id">160</a> It was the grandfather of the Artayctes, one Artembares by name,
who suggested to the Persians a proposal which they readily
embraced, and thus urged upon Cyrus:- "Since Jove," they said, "has
overthrown Astyages, and given the rule to the Persians, and to thee
chiefly, O Cyrus! come now, let us quit this land wherein we dwell-
for it is a scant land and a rugged- and let us choose ourselves
some other better country. Many such lie around us, some nearer,
some further off: if we take one of these, men will admire us far more
than they do now. Who that had the power would not so act? And when
shall we have a fairer time than now, when we are lords of so many
nations, and rule all Asia?" Then Cyrus, who did not greatly esteem
the counsel, told them,- "they might do so, if they liked- but he
warned them not to expect in that case to continue rulers, but to
prepare for being ruled by others- soft countries gave birth to soft
men- there was no region which produced very delightful fruits, and at
the same time men of a warlike spirit." So the Persians departed
with altered minds, confessing that Cyrus was wiser than they; and
chose rather to dwell in a churlish land, and exercise lordship,
than to cultivate plains, and be the slaves of others.</p>
<p id="passage-161"><a href="#passage-161" class="passage-id">161</a> ***THE END***</p>
