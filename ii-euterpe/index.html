        <h1>II EUTERPE</h1>

        <p id="passage-1"><a href="#passage-1" class="passage-id">1</a> On the death of Cyrus, Cambyses his son by Cassandane daughter
of Pharnaspes took the kingdom. Cassandane had died in the lifetime of
Cyrus, who had made a great mourning for her at her death, and had
commanded all the subjects of his empire to observe the like.
Cambyses, the son of this lady and of Cyrus, regarding the Ionian
and Aeolian Greeks as vassals of his father, took them with him in his
expedition against Egypt among the other nations which owned his sway.</p>
<p id="passage-2"><a href="#passage-2" class="passage-id">2</a> Now the Egyptians, before the reign of their king Psammetichus,
believed themselves to be the most ancient of mankind. Since
Psammetichus, however, made an attempt to discover who were actually
the primitive race, they have been of opinion that while they
surpass all other nations, the Phrygians surpass them in antiquity.
This king, finding it impossible to make out by dint of inquiry what
men were the most ancient, contrived the following method of
discovery:- He took two children of the common sort, and gave them
over to a herdsman to bring up at his folds, strictly charging him
to let no one utter a word in their presence, but to keep them in a
sequestered cottage, and from time to time introduce goats to their
apartment, see that they got their fill of milk, and in all other
respects look after them. His object herein was to know, after the
indistinct babblings of infancy were over, what word they would
first articulate. It happened as he had anticipated. The herdsman
obeyed his orders for two years, and at the end of that time, on his
one day opening the door of their room and going in, the children both
ran up to him with outstretched arms, and distinctly said "Becos."
When this first happened the herdsman took no notice; but afterwards
when he observed, on coming often to see after them, that the word was
constantly in their mouths, he informed his lord, and by his command
brought the children into his presence. Psammetichus then himself
heard them say the word, upon which he proceeded to make inquiry
what people there was who called anything "becos," and hereupon he
learnt that "becos" was the Phrygian name for bread. In
consideration of this circumstance the Egyptians yielded their claims,
and admitted the greater antiquity of the Phrygians.</p>
<p id="passage-3"><a href="#passage-3" class="passage-id">3</a> That these were the real facts I learnt at Memphis from the
priests of Vulcan. The Greeks, among other foolish tales, relate
that Psammetichus had the children brought up by women whose tongues
he had previously cut out; but the priests said their bringing up
was such as I have stated above. I got much other information also
from conversation with these priests while I was at Memphis, and I
even went to Heliopolis and to Thebes, expressly to try whether the
priests of those places would agree in their accounts with the priests
at Memphis. The Heliopolitans have the reputation of being the best
skilled in history of all the Egyptians. What they told me
concerning their religion it is not my intention to repeat, except the
names of their deities, which I believe all men know equally. If I
relate anything else concerning these matters, it will only be when
compelled to do so by the course of my narrative.</p>
<p id="passage-4"><a href="#passage-4" class="passage-id">4</a> Now with regard to mere human matters, the accounts which they
gave, and in which all agreed, were the following. The Egyptians, they
said, were the first to discover the solar year, and to portion out
its course into twelve parts. They obtained this knowledge from the
stars. (To my mind they contrive their year much more cleverly than
the Greeks, for these last every other year intercalate a whole month,
but the Egyptians, dividing the year into twelve months of thirty days
each, add every year a space of five days besides, whereby the circuit
of the seasons is made to return with uniformity.) The Egyptians, they
went on to affirm, first brought into use the names of the twelve
gods, which the Greeks adopted from them; and first erected altars,
images, and temples to the gods; and also first engraved upon stone
the figures of animals. In most of these cases they proved to me
that what they said was true. And they told me that the first man
who ruled over Egypt was Min, and that in his time all Egypt, except
the Thebaic canton, was a marsh, none of the land below Lake Moeris
then showing itself above the surface of the water. This is a distance
of seven days' sail from the sea up the river.</p>
<p id="passage-5"><a href="#passage-5" class="passage-id">5</a> What they said of their country seemed to me very reasonable.
For any one who sees Egypt, without having heard a word about it
before, must perceive, if he has only common powers of observation,
that the Egypt to which the Greeks go in their ships is an acquired
country, the gift of the river. The same is true of the land above the
lake, to the distance of three days' voyage, concerning which the
Egyptians say nothing, but which exactly the same kind of country.</p>
<p id="passage-6"><a href="#passage-6" class="passage-id">6</a> The following is the general character of the region. In the first
place, on approaching it by sea, when you are still a day's sail
from the land, if you let down a sounding-line you will bring up
mud, and find yourself in eleven fathoms' water, which shows that
the soil washed down by the stream extends to that distance.</p>
<p id="passage-7"><a href="#passage-7" class="passage-id">7</a> The length of the country along shore, according to the bounds
that we assign to Egypt, namely from the Plinthinetic gulf to Lake
Serbonis, which extends along the base of Mount Casius, is sixty
schoenes. The nations whose territories are scanty measure them by the
fathom; those whose bounds are less confined, by the furlong; those
who have an ample territory, by the parasang; but if men have a
country which is very vast, they measure it by the schoene. Now the
length of the parasang is thirty furlongs, but the schoene, which is
an Egyptian measure, is sixty furlongs. Thus the coastline of Egypt
would extend a length of three thousand six hundred furlongs.</p>
<p id="passage-8"><a href="#passage-8" class="passage-id">8</a> From the coast inland as far as Heliopolis the breadth of Egypt is
considerable, the country is flat, without springs, and full of
swamps. The length of the route from the sea up to Heliopolis is
almost exactly the same as that of the road which runs from the
altar of the twelve gods at Athens to the temple of Olympian Jove at
Pisa. If a person made a calculation he would find but a very little
difference between the two routes, not more than about fifteen
furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa falls short of fifteen
hundred furlongs by exactly fifteen, whereas the distance of
Heliopolis from the sea is just the round number.</p>
<p id="passage-9"><a href="#passage-9" class="passage-id">9</a> As one proceeds beyond Heliopolis up the country, Egypt becomes
narrow, the Arabian range of hills, which has a direction from north
to south, shutting it in upon the one side, and the Libyan range
upon the other. The former ridge runs on without a break, and
stretches away to the sea called the Erythraean; it contains the
quarries whence the stone was cut for the pyramids of Memphis: and
this is the point where it ceases its first direction, and bends
away in the manner above indicated. In its greatest length from east
to west it is, as I have been informed, a distance of two months'
journey towards the extreme east its skirts produce frankincense. Such
are the chief features of this range. On the Libyan side, the other
ridge whereon the pyramids stand is rocky and covered with sand; its
direction is the same as that of the Arabian ridge in the first part
of its course. Above Heliopolis, then, there is no great breadth of
territory for such a country as Egypt, but during four days' sail
Egypt is narrow; the valley between the two ranges is a level plain,
and seemed to me to be, at the narrowest point, not more than two
hundred furlongs across from the Arabian to the Libyan hills. Above
this point Egypt again widens.</p>
<p id="passage-10"><a href="#passage-10" class="passage-id">10</a> From Heliopolis to Thebes is nine days' sail up the river; the
distance is eighty-one schoenes, or 4860 furlongs. If we now put
together the several measurements of the country we shall find that
the distance along shore is, as I stated above, 3600 furlongs, and the
distance from the sea inland to Thebes 6120 furlongs. Further, it is a
distance of eighteen hundred furlongs from Thebes to the place
called Elephantine.</p>
<p id="passage-11"><a href="#passage-11" class="passage-id">11</a> The greater portion of the country above described seemed to me to
be, as the priests declared, a tract gained by the inhabitants. For
the whole region above Memphis, lying between the two ranges of
hills that have been spoken of, appeared evidently to have formed at
one time a gulf of the sea. It resembles (to compare small things with
great) the parts about Ilium and Teuthrania, Ephesus, and the plain of
the Maeander. In all these regions the land has been formed by rivers,
whereof the greatest is not to compare for size with any one of the
five mouths of the Nile. I could mention other rivers also, far
inferior to the Nile in magnitude, that have effected very great
changes. Among these not the least is the Achelous, which, after
passing through Acarnania, empties itself into the sea opposite the
islands called Echinades, and has already joined one-half of them to
the continent.</p>
<p id="passage-12"><a href="#passage-12" class="passage-id">12</a> In Arabia, not far from Egypt, there is a long and narrow gulf
running inland from the sea called the Erythraean, of which I will
here set down the dimensions. Starting from its innermost recess,
and using a row-boat, you take forty days to reach the open main,
while you may cross the gulf at its widest part in the space of half a
day. In this sea there is an ebb and flow of the tide every day. My
opinion is that Egypt was formerly very much such a gulf as this-
one gulf penetrated from the sea that washes Egypt on the north, and
extended itself towards Ethiopia; another entered from the southern
ocean, and stretched towards Syria; the two gulfs ran into the land so
as almost to meet each other, and left between them only a very narrow
tract of country. Now if the Nile should choose to divert his waters
from their present bed into this Arabian gulf, what is there to hinder
it from being filled up by the stream within, at the utmost, twenty
thousand years? For my part, I think it would be filled in half the
time. How then should not a gulf, even of much greater size, have been
filled up in the ages that passed before I was born, by a river that
is at once so large and so given to working changes?</p>
<p id="passage-13"><a href="#passage-13" class="passage-id">13</a> Thus I give credit to those from whom I received this account of
Egypt, and am myself, moreover, strongly of the same opinion, since
I remarked that the country projects into the sea further than the
neighbouring shores, and I observed that there were shells upon the
hills, and that salt exuded from the soil to such an extent as even to
injure the pyramids; and I noticed also that there is but a single
hill in all Egypt where sand is found, namely, the hill above Memphis;
and further, I found the country to bear no resemblance either to
its borderland Arabia, or to Libya- nay, nor even to Syria, which
forms the seaboard of Arabia; but whereas the soil of Libya is, we
know, sandy and of a reddish hue, and that of Arabia and Syria
inclines to stone and clay, Egypt has a soil that is black and
crumbly, as being alluvial and formed of the deposits brought down
by the river from Ethiopia.</p>
<p id="passage-14"><a href="#passage-14" class="passage-id">14</a> One fact which I learnt of the priests is to me a strong
evidence of the origin of the country. They said that when Moeris
was king, the Nile overflowed all Egypt below Memphis, as soon as it
rose so little as eight cubits. Now Moeris had not been dead 900 years
at the time when I heard this of the priests; yet at the present
day, unless the river rise sixteen, or, at the very least, fifteen
cubits, it does not overflow the lands. It seems to me, therefore,
that if the land goes on rising and growing at this rate, the
Egyptians who dwell below Lake Moeris, in the Delta (as it is
called) and elsewhere, will one day, by the stoppage of the
inundations, suffer permanently the fate which they told me they
expected would some time or other befall the Greeks. On hearing that
the whole land of Greece is watered by rain from heaven, and not, like
their own, inundated by rivers, they observed- "Some day the Greeks
will be disappointed of their grand hope, and then they will be
wretchedly hungry"; which was as much as to say, "If God shall some
day see fit not to grant the Greeks rain, but shall afflict them
with a long drought, the Greeks will be swept away by a famine,
since they have nothing to rely on but rain from Jove, and have no
other resource for water."</p>
<p id="passage-15"><a href="#passage-15" class="passage-id">15</a> And certes, in thus speaking of the Greeks the Egyptians say
nothing but what is true. But now let me tell the Egyptians how the
case stands with themselves. If, as I said before, the country below
Memphis, which is the land that is always rising, continues to
increase in height at the rate at which it has risen in times gone by,
how will it be possible for the inhabitants of that region to avoid
hunger, when they will certainly have no rain, and the river will
not be able to overflow their cornlands? At present, it must be
confessed, they obtain the fruits of the field with less trouble
than any other people in the world, the rest of the Egyptians
included, since they have no need to break up the ground with the
plough, nor to use the hoe, nor to do any of the work which the rest
of mankind find necessary if they are to get a crop; but the
husbandman waits till the river has of its own accord spread itself
over the fields and withdrawn again to its bed, and then sows his plot
of ground, and after sowing turns his swine into it- the swine tread
in the corn- after which he has only to await the harvest. The swine
serve him also to thrash the grain, which is then carried to the
garner.</p>
<p id="passage-16"><a href="#passage-16" class="passage-id">16</a> If then we choose to adopt the views of the Ionians concerning
Egypt, we must come to the conclusion that the Egyptians had
formerly no country at all. For the Ionians say that nothing is really
Egypt but the Delta, which extends along shore from the Watch-tower of
Perseus, as it is called, to the Pelusiac Salt-Pans, a distance of
forty schoenes, and stretches inland as far as the city of Cercasorus,
where the Nile divides into the two streams which reach the sea at
Pelusium and Canobus respectively. The rest of what is accounted Egypt
belongs, they say, either to Arabia or Libya. But the Delta, as the
Egyptians affirm, and as I myself am persuaded, is formed of the
deposits of the river, and has only recently, if I may use the
expression, come to light. If, then, they had formerly no territory at
all, how came they to be so extravagant as to fancy themselves the
most ancient race in the world? Surely there was no need of their
making the experiment with the children to see what language they
would first speak. But in truth I do not believe that the Egyptians
came into being at the same time with the Delta, as the Ionians call
it; I think they have always existed ever since the human race
began; as the land went on increasing, part of the population came
down into the new country, part remained in their old settlements.
In ancient times the Thebais bore the name of Egypt, a district of
which the entire circumference is but 6120 furlongs.</p>
<p id="passage-17"><a href="#passage-17" class="passage-id">17</a> If, then, my judgment on these matters be right, the Ionians are
mistaken in what they say of Egypt. If, on the contrary, it is they
who are right, then I undertake to show that neither the Ionians nor
any of the other Greeks know how to count. For they all say that the
earth is divided into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya, whereas
they ought to add a fourth part, the Delta of Egypt, since they do not
include it either in Asia or Libya. For is it not their theory that
the Nile separates Asia from Libya? As the Nile, therefore, splits
in two at the apex of the Delta, the Delta itself must be a separate
country, not contained in either Asia or Libya.</p>
<p id="passage-18"><a href="#passage-18" class="passage-id">18</a> Here I take my leave of the opinions of the Ionians, and proceed
to deliver my own sentiments on these subjects. I consider Egypt to be
the whole country inhabited by the Egyptians, just as Cilicia is the
tract occupied by the Cilicians, and Assyria that possessed by the
Assyrians. And I regard the only proper boundary-line between Libya
and Asia to be that which is marked out by the Egyptian frontier.
For if we take the boundary-line commonly received by the Greeks, we
must regard Egypt as divided, along its whole length from
Elephantine and the Cataracts to Cercasorus, into two parts, each
belonging to a different portion of the world, one to Asia, the
other to Libya; since the Nile divides Egypt in two from the Cataracts
to the sea, running as far as the city of Cercasorus in a single
stream, but at that point separating into three branches, whereof
the one which bends eastward is called the Pelusiac mouth, and that
which slants to the west, the Canobic. Meanwhile the straight course
of the stream, which comes down from the upper country and meets the
apex of the Delta, continues on, dividing the Delta down the middle,
and empties itself into the sea by a mouth, which is as celebrated,
and carries as large a body of water, as most of the others, the mouth
called the Sebennytic. Besides these there are two other mouths
which run out of the Sebennytic called respectively the Saitic and the
Mendesian. The Bolbitine mouth, and the Bucolic, are not natural
branches, but channels made by excavation.</p>
<p id="passage-19"><a href="#passage-19" class="passage-id">19</a> My judgment as to the extent of Egypt is confirmed by an oracle
delivered at the shrine of Ammon, of which I had no knowledge at all
until after I had formed my opinion. It happened that the people of
the cities Marea and Apis, who live in the part of Egypt that
borders on Libya, took a dislike to the religious usages of the
country concerning sacrificial animals, and wished no longer to be
restricted from eating the flesh of cows. So, as they believed
themselves to be Libyans and not Egyptians, they sent to the shrine to
say that, having nothing in common with the Egyptians, neither
inhabiting the Delta nor using the Egyptian tongue, they claimed to be
allowed to eat whatever they pleased. Their request, however, was
refused by the god, who declared in reply that Egypt was the entire
tract of country which the Nile overspreads and irrigates, and the
Egyptians were the people who lived below Elephantine, and drank the
waters of that river.</p>
<p id="passage-20"><a href="#passage-20" class="passage-id">20</a> So said the oracle. Now the Nile, when it overflows, floods not
only the Delta, but also the tracts of country on both sides the
stream which are thought to belong to Libya and Arabia, in some places
reaching to the extent of two days' journey from its banks, in some
even exceeding that distance, but in others falling short of it.</p>
<p id="passage-21"><a href="#passage-21" class="passage-id">21</a> Concerning the nature of the river, I was not able to gain any
information either from the priests or from others. I was particularly
anxious to learn from them why the Nile, at the commencement of the
summer solstice, begins to rise, and continues to increase for a
hundred days- and why, as soon as that number is past, it forthwith
retires and contracts its stream, continuing low during the whole of
the winter until the summer solstice comes round again. On none of
these points could I obtain any explanation from the inhabitants,
though I made every inquiry, wishing to know what was commonly
reported- they could neither tell me what special virtue the Nile
has which makes it so opposite in its nature to all other streams, nor
why, unlike every other river, it gives forth no breezes from its
surface.</p>
<p id="passage-22"><a href="#passage-22" class="passage-id">22</a> Some of the Greeks, however, wishing to get a reputation for
cleverness, have offered explanations of the phenomena of the river,
for which they have accounted in three different ways. Two of these
I do not think it worth while to speak of, further than simply to
mention what they are. One pretends that the Etesian winds cause the
rise of the river by preventing the Nile-water from running off into
the sea. But in the first place it has often happened, when the
Etesian winds did not blow, that the Nile has risen according to its
usual wont; and further, if the Etesian winds produced the effect, the
other rivers which flow in a direction opposite to those winds ought
to present the same phenomena as the Nile, and the more so as they are
all smaller streams, and have a weaker current. But these rivers, of
which there are many both in Syria and Libya, are entirely unlike
the Nile in this respect.</p>
<p id="passage-23"><a href="#passage-23" class="passage-id">23</a> The second opinion is even more unscientific than the one just
mentioned, and also, if I may so say, more marvellous. It is that
the Nile acts so strangely, because it flows from the ocean, and
that the ocean flows all round the earth.</p>
<p id="passage-24"><a href="#passage-24" class="passage-id">24</a> The third explanation, which is very much more plausible than
either of the others, is positively the furthest from the truth; for
there is really nothing in what it says, any more than in the other
theories. It is, that the inundation of the Nile is caused by the
melting of snows. Now, as the Nile flows out of Libya, through
Ethiopia, into Egypt, how is it possible that it can be formed of
melted snow, running, as it does, from the hottest regions of the
world into cooler countries? Many are the proofs whereby any one
capable of reasoning on the subject may be convinced that it is most
unlikely this should be the case. The first and strongest argument
is furnished by the winds, which always blow hot from these regions.
The second is that rain and frost are unknown there. Now whenever snow
falls, it must of necessity rain within five days;.so that, if there
were snow, there must be rain also in those parts. Thirdly, it is
certain that the natives of the country are black with the heat,
that the kites and the swallows remain there the whole year, and
that the cranes, when they fly from the rigours of a Scythian
winter, flock thither to pass the cold season. If then, in the country
whence the Nile has its source, or in that through which it flows,
there fell ever so little snow, it is absolutely impossible that any
of these circumstances could take place.</p>
<p id="passage-25"><a href="#passage-25" class="passage-id">25</a> As for the writer who attributes the phenomenon to the ocean,
his account is involved in such obscurity that it is impossible to
disprove it by argument. For my part I know of no river called
Ocean, and I think that Homer, or one of the earlier poets, invented
the name, and introduced it into his poetry.</p>
<p id="passage-26"><a href="#passage-26" class="passage-id">26</a> Perhaps, after censuring all the opinions that have been put
forward on this obscure subject, one ought to propose some theory of
one's own. I will therefore proceed to explain what I think to be
the reason of the Nile's swelling in the summer time. During the
winter, the sun is driven out of his usual course by the storms, and
removes to the upper parts of Libya. This is the whole secret in the
fewest possible words; for it stands to reason that the country to
which the Sun-god approaches the nearest, and which he passes most
directly over, will be scantest of water, and that there the streams
which feed the rivers will shrink the most.</p>
<p id="passage-27"><a href="#passage-27" class="passage-id">27</a> To explain, however, more at length, the case is this. The sun, in
his passage across the upper parts of Libya, affects them in the
following way. As the air in those regions is constantly clear, and
the country warm through the absence of cold winds, the sun in his
passage across them acts upon them exactly as he wont to act elsewhere
in summer, when his path is in the middle of heaven- that is, he
attracts the water. After attracting it, he again repels it into the
upper regions, where the winds lay hold of it, scatter it, and
reduce it to a vapour, whence it naturally enough comes to pass that
the winds which blow from this quarter- the south and south-west-
are of all winds the most rainy. And my own opinion is that the sun
does not get rid of all the water which he draws year by year from the
Nile, but retains some about him. When the winter begins to soften,
the sun goes back again to his old place in the middle of the
heaven, and proceeds to attract water equally from all countries. Till
then the other rivers run big, from the quantity of rain-water which
they bring down from countries where so much moisture falls that all
the land is cut into gullies; but in summer, when the showers fail,
and the sun attracts their water, they become low. The Nile, on the
contrary, not deriving any of its bulk from rains, and being in winter
subject to the attraction of the sun, naturally runs at that season,
unlike all other streams, with a less burthen of water than in the
summer time. For in summer it is exposed to attraction equally with
all other rivers, but in winter it suffers alone. The sun,
therefore, I regard as the sole cause of the phenomenon.</p>
<p id="passage-28"><a href="#passage-28" class="passage-id">28</a> It is the sun also, in my opinion, which, by heating the space
through which it passes, makes the air in Egypt so dry. There is
thus perpetual summer in the upper parts of Libya. Were the position
of the heavenly regions reversed, so that the place where now the
north wind and the winter have their dwelling became the station of
the south wind and of the noon-day, while, on the other hand, the
station of the south wind became that of the north, the consequence
would be that the sun, driven from the mid-heaven by the winter and
the northern gales, would betake himself to the upper parts of Europe,
as he now does to those of Libya, and then I believe his passage
across Europe would affect the Ister exactly as the Nile is affected
at the present day.</p>
<p id="passage-29"><a href="#passage-29" class="passage-id">29</a> And with respect to the fact that no breeze blows from the Nile, I
am of opinion that no wind is likely to arise in very hot countries,
for breezes love to blow from some cold quarter.</p>
<p id="passage-30"><a href="#passage-30" class="passage-id">30</a> Let us leave these things, however, to their natural course, to
continue as they are and have been from the beginning. With regard
to the sources of the Nile, I have found no one among all those with
whom I have conversed, whether Egyptians, Libyans, or Greeks, who
professed to have any knowledge, except a single person. He was the
scribe who kept the register of the sacred treasures of Minerva in the
city of Sais, and he did not seem to me to be in earnest when he
said that he knew them perfectly well. His story was as follows:-
"Between Syene, a city of the Thebais, and Elephantine, there are" (he
said) "two hills with sharp conical tops; the name of the one is
Crophi, of the other, Mophi. Midway between them are the fountains
of the Nile, fountains which it is impossible to fathom. Half the
water runs northward into Egypt, half to the south towards
Ethiopia." The fountains were known to be unfathomable, he declared,
because Psammetichus, an Egyptian king, had made trial of them. He had
caused a rope to be made, many thousand fathoms in length, and had
sounded the fountain with it, but could find no bottom. By this the
scribe gave me to understand, if there was any truth at all in what he
said, that in this fountain there are certain strong eddies, and a
regurgitation, owing to the force wherewith the water dashes against
the mountains, and hence a Sounding-line cannot be got to reach the
bottom of the spring.</p>
<p id="passage-31"><a href="#passage-31" class="passage-id">31</a> No other information on this head could I obtain from any quarter.
All that I succeeded in learning further of the more distant
portions of the Nile, by ascending myself as high as Elephantine and
making inquiries concerning the parts beyond, was the following:- As
one advances beyond Elephantine, the land rises. Hence it is necessary
in this part of the river to attach a rope to the boat on each side,
as men harness an ox, and so proceed on the journey. If the rope
snaps, the vessel is borne away down stream by the force of the
current. The navigation continues the same for four days, the river
winding greatly, like the Maeander, and the distance traversed
amounting to twelve schoenes. Here you come upon a smooth and level
plain, where the Nile flows in two branches, round an island called
Tachompso. The country above Elephantine is inhabited by the
Ethiopians, who possess one-half of this island, the Egyptians
occupying the other. Above the island there is a great lake, the
shores of which are inhabited by Ethiopian nomads; after passing it,
you come again to the stream of the Nile, which runs into the lake.
Here you land, and travel for forty days along the banks of the river,
since it is impossible to proceed further in a boat on account of
the sharp peaks which jut out from the water, and the sunken rocks
which abound in that part of the stream. When you have passed this
portion of the river in the space of forty days, you go on board
another boat and proceed by water for twelve days more, at the end
of which time you reach a great city called Meroe, which is said to be
the capital of the other Ethiopians. The only gods worshipped by the
inhabitants are Jupiter and Bacchus, to whom great honours are paid.
There is an oracle of Jupiter in the city, which directs the warlike
expeditions of the Ethiopians; when it commands they go to war, and in
whatever direction it bids them march, thither straightway they
carry their arms.</p>
<p id="passage-32"><a href="#passage-32" class="passage-id">32</a> On leaving this city, and again mounting the stream, in the same
space of time which it took you to reach the capital from Elephantine,
you come to the Deserters, who bear the name of Asmach. This word,
translated into our language, means "the men who stand on the left
hand of the king." These Deserters are Egyptians of the warrior caste,
who, to the number of two hundred and forty thousand, went over to the
Ethiopians in the reign of king Psammetichus. The cause of their
desertion was the following:- Three garrisons were maintained in Egypt
at that time, one in the city of Elephantine against the Ethiopians,
another in the Pelusiac Daphnae, against the Syrians and Arabians, and
a third, against the Libyans, in Marea. (The very same posts are to
this day occupied by the Persians, whose forces are in garrison both
in Daphnae and in Elephantine.) Now it happened, that on one
occasion the garrisons were not relieved during the space of three
years; the soldiers, therefore, at the end of that time, consulted
together, and having determined by common consent to revolt, marched
away towards Ethiopia. Psammetichus, informed of the movement, set out
in pursuit, and coming up with them, besought them with many words not
to desert the gods of their country, nor abandon their wives and
children. "Nay, but," said one of the deserters with an unseemly
gesture, "wherever we go, we are sure enough of finding wives and
children." Arrived in Ethiopia, they placed themselves at the disposal
of the king. In return, he made them a present of a tract of land
which belonged to certain Ethiopians with whom he was at feud, bidding
them expel the inhabitants and take possession of their territory.
>From the time that this settlement was formed, their acquaintance with
Egyptian manners has tended to civilise the Ethiopians.</p>
<p id="passage-33"><a href="#passage-33" class="passage-id">33</a> Thus the course of the Nile is known, not only throughout Egypt,
but to the extent of four months' journey either by land or water
above the Egyptian boundary; for on calculation it will be found
that it takes that length of time to travel from Elephantine to the
country of the Deserters. There the direction of the river is from
west to east. Beyond, no one has any certain knowledge of its
course, since the country is uninhabited by reason of the excessive
heat.</p>
<p id="passage-34"><a href="#passage-34" class="passage-id">34</a> I did hear, indeed, what I will now relate, from certain natives
of Cyrene. Once upon a time, they said, they were on a visit to the
oracular shrine of Ammon, when it chanced that in the course of
conversation with Etearchus, the Ammonian king, the talk fell upon the
Nile, how that its sources were unknown to all men. Etearchus upon
this mentioned that some Nasamonians had once come to his court, and
when asked if they could give any information concerning the
uninhabited parts of Libya, had told the following tale. (The
Nasamonians are a Libyan race who occupy the Syrtis, and a tract of no
great size towards the east.) They said there had grown up among
them some wild young men, the sons of certain chiefs, who, when they
came to man's estate, indulged in all manner of extravagancies, and
among other things drew lots for five of their number to go and
explore the desert parts of Libya, and try if they could not penetrate
further than any had done previously. The coast of Libya along the sea
which washes it to the north, throughout its entire length from
Egypt to Cape Soloeis, which is its furthest point, is inhabited by
Libyans of many distinct tribes who possess the whole tract except
certain portions which belong to the Phoenicians and the Greeks. Above
the coast-line and the country inhabited by the maritime tribes, Libya
is full of wild beasts; while beyond the wild beast region there is
a tract which is wholly sand, very scant of water, and utterly and
entirely a desert. The young men therefore, despatched on this
errand by their comrades with a plentiful supply of water and
provisions, travelled at first through the inhabited region, passing
which they came to the wild beast tract, whence they finally entered
upon the desert, which they proceeded to cross in a direction from
east to west. After journeying for many days over a wide extent of
sand, they came at last to a plain where they observed trees
growing; approaching them, and seeing fruit on them, they proceeded to
gather it. While they were thus engaged, there came upon them some
dwarfish men, under the middle height, who seized them and carried
them off. The Nasamonians could not understand a word of their
language, nor had they any acquaintance with the language of the
Nasamonians. They were led across extensive marshes, and finally
came to a town, where all the men were of the height of their
conductors, and black-complexioned. A great river flowed by the
town, running from west to east, and containing crocodiles.</p>
<p id="passage-35"><a href="#passage-35" class="passage-id">35</a> Here let me dismiss Etearchus the Ammonian, and his story, only
adding that (according to the Cyrenaeans) he declared that the
Nasamonians got safe back to their country, and that the men whose
city they had reached were a nation of sorcerers. With respect to
the river which ran by their town, Etearchus conjectured it to be
the Nile; and reason favours that view. For the Nile certainly flows
out of Libya, dividing it down the middle, and as I conceive,
judging the unknown from the known, rises at the same distance from
its mouth as the Ister. This latter river has its source in the
country of the Celts near the city Pyrene, and runs through the middle
of Europe, dividing it into two portions. The Celts live beyond the
pillars of Hercules, and border on the Cynesians, who dwell at the
extreme west of Europe. Thus the Ister flows through the whole of
Europe before it finally empties itself into the Euxine at Istria, one
of the colonies of the Milesians.</p>
<p id="passage-36"><a href="#passage-36" class="passage-id">36</a> Now as this river flows through regions that are inhabited, its
course is perfectly well known; but of the sources of the Nile no
one can give any account, since Libya, the country through which it
passes, is desert and without inhabitants. As far as it was possible
to get information by inquiry, I have given a description of the
stream. It enters Egypt from the parts beyond. Egypt lies almost
exactly opposite the mountainous portion of Cilicia, whence a
lightly-equipped traveller may reach Sinope on the Euxine in five days
by the direct route. Sinope lies opposite the place where the Ister
falls into the sea. My opinion therefore is that the Nile, as it
traverses the whole of Libya, is of equal length with the Ister. And
here I take my leave of this subject.</p>
<p id="passage-37"><a href="#passage-37" class="passage-id">37</a> Concerning Egypt itself I shall extend my remarks to a great
length, because there is no country that possesses so many wonders,
nor any that has such a number of works which defy description. Not
only is the climate different from that of the rest of the world,
and the rivers unlike any other rivers, but the people also, in most
of their manners and customs, exactly reverse the common practice of
mankind. The women attend the markets and trade, while the men sit
at home at the loom; and here, while the rest of the world works the
woof up the warp, the Egyptians work it down; the women likewise carry
burthens upon their shoulders, while the men carry them upon their
heads. They eat their food out of doors in the streets, but retire for
private purposes to their houses, giving as a reason that what is
unseemly, but necessary, ought to be done in secret, but what has
nothing unseemly about it, should be done openly. A woman cannot serve
the priestly office, either for god or goddess, but men are priests to
both; sons need not support their parents unless they choose, but
daughters must, whether they choose or no.</p>
<p id="passage-38"><a href="#passage-38" class="passage-id">38</a> In other countries the priests have long hair, in Egypt their
heads are shaven; elsewhere it is customary, in mourning, for near
relations to cut their hair close: the Egyptians, who wear no hair
at any other time, when they lose a relative, let their beards and the
hair of their heads grow long. All other men pass their lives separate
from animals, the Egyptians have animals always living with them;
others make barley and wheat their food; it is a disgrace to do so
in Egypt, where the grain they live on is spelt, which some call
zea. Dough they knead with their feet; but they mix mud, and even take
up dirt, with their hands. They are the only people in the world- they
at least, and such as have learnt the practice from them- who use
circumcision. Their men wear two garments apiece, their women but one.
They put on the rings and fasten the ropes to sails inside; others put
them outside. When they write or calculate, instead of going, like the
Greeks, from left to right, they move their hand from right to left;
and they insist, notwithstanding, that it is they who go to the right,
and the Greeks who go to the left. They have two quite different kinds
of writing, one of which is called sacred, the other common.</p>
<p id="passage-39"><a href="#passage-39" class="passage-id">39</a> They are religious to excess, far beyond any other race of men,
and use the following ceremonies:- They drink out of brazen cups,
which they scour every day: there is no exception to this practice.
They wear linen garments, which they are specially careful to have
always fresh washed. They practise circumcision for the sake of
cleanliness, considering it better to be cleanly than comely. The
priests shave their whole body every other day, that no lice or
other impure thing may adhere to them when they are engaged in the
service of the gods. Their dress is entirely of linen, and their shoes
of the papyrus plant: it is not lawful for them to wear either dress
or shoes of any other material. They bathe twice every day in cold
water, and twice each night; besides which they observe, so to
speak, thousands of ceremonies. They enjoy, however, not a few
advantages. They consume none of their own property, and are at no
expense for anything; but every day bread is baked for them of the
sacred corn, and a plentiful supply of beef and of goose's flesh is
assigned to each, and also a portion of wine made from the grape. Fish
they are not allowed to eat; and beans- which none of the Egyptians
ever sow, or eat, if they come up of their own accord, either raw or
boiled- the priests will not even endure to look on, since they
consider it an unclean kind of pulse. Instead of a single priest, each
god has the attendance of a college, at the head of which is a chief
priest; when one of these dies, his son is appointed in his room.</p>
<p id="passage-40"><a href="#passage-40" class="passage-id">40</a> Male kine are reckoned to belong to Epaphus, and are therefore
tested in the following manner:- One of the priests appointed for
the purpose searches to see if there is a single black hair on the
whole body, since in that case the beast is unclean. He examines him
all over, standing on his legs, and again laid upon his back; after
which he takes the tongue out of his mouth, to see if it be clean in
respect of the prescribed marks (what they are I will mention
elsewhere); he also inspects the hairs of the tail, to observe if they
grow naturally. If the animal is pronounced clean in all these various
points, the priest marks him by twisting a piece of papyrus round
his horns, and attaching thereto some sealing-clay, which he then
stamps with his own signet-ring. After this the beast is led away; and
it is forbidden, under the penalty of death, to sacrifice an animal
which has not been marked in this way.</p>
<p id="passage-41"><a href="#passage-41" class="passage-id">41</a> The following is their manner of sacrifice:- They lead the victim,
marked with their signet, to the altar where they are about to offer
it, and setting the wood alight, pour a libation of wine upon the
altar in front of the victim, and at the same time invoke the god.
Then they slay the animal, and cutting off his head, proceed to flay
the body. Next they take the head, and heaping imprecations on it,
if there is a market-place and a body of Greek traders in the city,
they carry it there and sell it instantly; if, however, there are no
Greeks among them, they throw the head into the river. The imprecation
is to this effect:- They pray that if any evil is impending either
over those who sacrifice, or over universal Egypt, it may be made to
fall upon that head. These practices, the imprecations upon the heads,
and the libations of wine, prevail all over Egypt, and extend to
victims of all sorts; and hence the Egyptians will never eat the
head of any animal.</p>
<p id="passage-42"><a href="#passage-42" class="passage-id">42</a> The disembowelling and burning are, however, different in
different sacrifices. I will mention the mode in use with respect to
the goddess whom they regard as the greatest, and honour with the
chiefest festival. When they have flayed their steer they pray, and
when their prayer is ended they take the paunch of the animal out
entire, leaving the intestines and the fat inside the body; they
then cut off the legs, the ends of the loins, the shoulders, and the
neck; and having so done, they fill the body of the steer with clean
bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other aromatics.
Thus filled, they burn the body, pouring over it great quantities of
oil. Before offering the sacrifice they fast, and while the bodies
of the victims are being consumed they beat themselves. Afterwards,
when they have concluded this part of the ceremony, they have the
other parts of the victim served up to them for a repast.</p>
<p id="passage-43"><a href="#passage-43" class="passage-id">43</a> The male kine, therefore, if clean, and the male calves, are
used for sacrifice by the Egyptians universally; but the females
they are not allowed to sacrifice, since they are sacred to Isis.
The statue of this goddess has the form of a woman but with horns like
a cow, resembling thus the Greek representations of Io; and the
Egyptians, one and all, venerate cows much more highly than any
other animal. This is the reason why no native of Egypt, whether man
or woman, will give a Greek a kiss, or use the knife of a Greek, or
his spit, or his cauldron, or taste the flesh of an ox, known to be
pure, if it has been cut with a Greek knife. When kine die, the
following is the manner of their sepulture:- The females are thrown
into the river; the males are buried in the suburbs of the towns, with
one or both of their horns appearing above the surface of the ground
to mark the place. When the bodies are decayed, a boat comes, at an
appointed time, from the island called Prosopitis,- which is a portion
of the Delta, nine schoenes in circumference,- and calls at the
several cities in turn to collect the bones of the oxen. Prosopitis is
a district containing several cities; the name of that from which
the boats come is Atarbechis. Venus has a temple there of much
sanctity. Great numbers of men go forth from this city and proceed
to the other towns, where they dig up the bones, which they take
away with them and bury together in one place. The same practice
prevails with respect to the interment of all other cattle- the law so
determining; they do not slaughter any of them.</p>
<p id="passage-44"><a href="#passage-44" class="passage-id">44</a> Such Egyptians as possess a temple of the Theban Jove, or live
in the Thebaic canton, offer no sheep in sacrifice, but only goats;
for the Egyptians do not all worship the same gods, excepting Isis and
Osiris, the latter of whom they say is the Grecian Bacchus. Those,
on the contrary, who possess a temple dedicated to Mendes, or belong
to the Mendesian canton, abstain from offering goats, and sacrifice
sheep instead. The Thebans, and such as imitate them in their
practice, give the following account of the origin of the custom:-
"Hercules," they say, "wished of all things to see Jove, but Jove
did not choose to be seen of him. At length, when Hercules
persisted, Jove hit on a device- to flay a ram, and, cutting off his
head, hold the head before him, and cover himself with the fleece.
In this guise he showed himself to Hercules." Therefore the
Egyptians give their statues of Jupiter the face of a ram: and from
them the practice has passed to the Ammonians, who are a joint
colony of Egyptians and Ethiopians, speaking a language between the
two; hence also, in my opinion, the latter people took their name of
Ammonians, since the Egyptian name for Jupiter is Amun. Such, then, is
the reason why the Thebans do not sacrifice rams, but consider them
sacred animals. Upon one day in the year, however, at the festival
of Jupiter, they slay a single ram, and stripping off the fleece,
cover with it the statue of that god, as he once covered himself,
and then bring up to the statue of Jove an image of Hercules. When
this has been done, the whole assembly beat their breasts in
mourning for the ram, and afterwards bury him in a holy sepulchre.</p>
<p id="passage-45"><a href="#passage-45" class="passage-id">45</a> The account which I received of this Hercules makes him one of the
twelve gods. Of the other Hercules, with whom the Greeks are familiar,
I could hear nothing in any part of Egypt. That the Greeks, however
(those I mean who gave the son of Amphitryon that name), took the name
from the Egyptians, and not the Egyptians from the Greeks, is I
think clearly proved, among other arguments, by the fact that both the
parents of Hercules, Amphitryon as well as Alcmena, were of Egyptian
origin. Again, the Egyptians disclaim all knowledge of the names of
Neptune and the Dioscuri, and do not include them in the number of
their gods; but had they adopted the name of any god from the
Greeks, these would have been the likeliest to obtain notice, since
the Egyptians, as I am well convinced, practised navigation at that
time, and the Greeks also were some of them mariners, so that they
would have been more likely to know the names of these gods than
that of Hercules. But the Egyptian Hercules is one of their ancient
gods. Seventeen thousand years before the reign of Amasis, the
twelve gods were, they affirm, produced from the eight: and of these
twelve, Hercules is one.</p>
<p id="passage-46"><a href="#passage-46" class="passage-id">46</a> In the wish to get the best information that I could on these
matters, I made a voyage to Tyre in Phoenicia, hearing there was a
temple of Hercules at that place, very highly venerated. I visited the
temple, and found it richly adorned with a number of offerings,
among which were two pillars, one of pure gold, the other of
emerald, shining with great brilliancy at night. In a conversation
which I held with the priests, I inquired how long their temple had
been built, and found by their answer that they, too, differed from
the Greeks. They said that the temple was built at the same time
that the city was founded, and that the foundation of the city took
place two thousand three hundred years ago. In Tyre I remarked another
temple where the same god was worshipped as the Thasian Hercules. So I
went on to Thasos, where I found a temple of Hercules which had been
built by the Phoenicians who colonised that island when they sailed in
search of Europa. Even this was five generations earlier than the time
when Hercules, son of Amphitryon, was born in Greece. These researches
show plainly that there is an ancient god Hercules; and my own opinion
is that those Greeks act most wisely who build and maintain two
temples of Hercules, in the one of which the Hercules worshipped is
known by the name of Olympian, and has sacrifice offered to him as
an immortal, while in the other the honours paid are such as are due
to a hero.</p>
<p id="passage-47"><a href="#passage-47" class="passage-id">47</a> The Greeks tell many tales without due investigation, and among
them the following silly fable respecting Hercules:- "Hercules,"
they say, "went once to Egypt, and there the inhabitants took him, and
putting a chaplet on his head, led him out in solemn procession,
intending to offer him a sacrifice to Jupiter. For a while he
submitted quietly; but when they led him up to the altar and began the
ceremonies, he put forth his strength and slew them all." Now to me it
seems that such a story proves the Greeks to be utterly ignorant of
the character and customs of the people. The Egyptians do not think it
allowable even to sacrifice cattle, excepting sheep, and the male kine
and calves, provided they be pure, and also geese. How, then, can it
be believed that they would sacrifice men? And again, how would it
have been possible for Hercules alone, and, as they confess, a mere
mortal, to destroy so many thousands? In saying thus much concerning
these matters, may I incur no displeasure either of god or hero!</p>
<p id="passage-48"><a href="#passage-48" class="passage-id">48</a> I mentioned above that some of the Egyptians abstain from
sacrificing goats, either male or female. The reason is the
following:- These Egyptians, who are the Mendesians, consider Pan to
be one of the eight gods who existed before the twelve, and Pan is
represented in Egypt by the painters and the sculptors, just as he
is in Greece, with the face and legs of a goat. They do not,
however, believe this to be his shape, or consider him in any
respect unlike the other gods; but they represent him thus for a
reason which I prefer not to relate. The Mendesians hold all goats
in veneration, but the male more than the female, giving the goatherds
of the males especial honour. One is venerated more highly than all
the rest, and when he dies there is a great mourning throughout all
the Mendesian canton. In Egyptian, the goat and Pan are both called
Mendes.</p>
<p id="passage-49"><a href="#passage-49" class="passage-id">49</a> The pig is regarded among them as an unclean animal, so much so
that if a man in passing accidentally touch a pig, he instantly
hurries to the river, and plunges in with all his clothes on. Hence,
too, the swineherds, notwithstanding that they are of pure Egyptian
blood, are forbidden to enter into any of the temples, which are
open to all other Egyptians; and further, no one will give his
daughter in marriage to a swineherd, or take a wife from among them,
so that the swineherds are forced to intermarry among themselves. They
do not offer swine in sacrifice to any of their gods, excepting
Bacchus and the Moon, whom they honour in this way at the same time,
sacrificing pigs to both of them at the same full moon, and afterwards
eating of the flesh. There is a reason alleged by them for their
detestation of swine at all other seasons, and their use of them at
this festival, with which I am well acquainted, but which I do not
think it proper to mention. The following is the mode in which they
sacrifice the swine to the Moon:- As soon as the victim is slain,
the tip of the tail, the spleen, and the caul are put together, and
having been covered with all the fat that has been found in the
animal's belly, are straightway burnt. The remainder of the flesh is
eaten on the same day that the sacrifice is offered, which is the
day of the full moon: at any other time they would not so much as
taste it. The poorer sort, who cannot afford live pigs, form pigs of
dough, which they bake and offer in sacrifice.</p>
<p id="passage-50"><a href="#passage-50" class="passage-id">50</a> To Bacchus, on the eve of his feast, every Egyptian sacrifices a
hog before the door of his house, which is then given back to the
swineherd by whom it was furnished, and by him carried away. In
other respects the festival is celebrated almost exactly as Bacchic
festivals are in Greece, excepting that the Egyptians have no choral
dances. They also use instead of phalli another invention,
consisting of images a cubit high, pulled by strings, which the
women carry round to the villages. A piper goes in front, and the
women follow, singing hymns in honour of Bacchus. They give a
religious reason for the peculiarities of the image.</p>
<p id="passage-51"><a href="#passage-51" class="passage-id">51</a> Melampus, the son of Amytheon, cannot (I think) have been ignorant
of this ceremony- nay, he must, I should conceive, have been well
acquainted with it. He it was who introduced into Greece the name of
Bacchus, the ceremonial of his worship, and the procession of the
phallus. He did not, however, so completely apprehend the whole
doctrine as to be able to communicate it entirely, but various sages
since his time have carried out his teaching to greater perfection.
Still it is certain that Melampus introduced the phallus, and that the
Greeks learnt from him the ceremonies which they now practise. I
therefore maintain that Melampus, who was a wise man, and had acquired
the art of divination, having become acquainted with the worship of
Bacchus through knowledge derived from Egypt, introduced it into
Greece, with a few slight changes, at the same time that he brought in
various other practices. For I can by no means allow that it is by
mere coincidence that the Bacchic ceremonies in Greece are so nearly
the same as the Egyptian- they would then have been more Greek in
their character, and less recent in their origin. Much less can I
admit that the Egyptians borrowed these customs, or any other, from
the Greeks. My belief is that Melampus got his knowledge of them
from Cadmus the Tyrian, and the followers whom he brought from
Phoenicia into the country which is now called Boeotia.</p>
<p id="passage-52"><a href="#passage-52" class="passage-id">52</a> Almost all the names of the gods came into Greece from Egypt. My
inquiries prove that they were all derived from a foreign source,
and my opinion is that Egypt furnished the greater number. For with
the exception of Neptune and the Dioscuri, whom I mentioned above, and
Juno, Vesta, Themis, the Graces, and the Nereids, the other gods
have been known from time immemorial in Egypt. This I assert on the
authority of the Egyptians themselves. The gods, with whose names they
profess themselves unacquainted, the Greeks received, I believe,
from the Pelasgi, except Neptune. Of him they got their knowledge from
the Libyans, by whom he has been always honoured, and who were
anciently the only people that had a god of the name. The Egyptians
differ from the Greeks also in paying no divine honours to heroes.</p>
<p id="passage-53"><a href="#passage-53" class="passage-id">53</a> Besides these which have been here mentioned, there are many other
practices whereof I shall speak hereafter, which the Greeks have
borrowed from Egypt. The peculiarity, however, which they observe in
their statues of Mercury they did not derive from the Egyptians, but
from the Pelasgi; from them the Athenians first adopted it, and
afterwards it passed from the Athenians to the other Greeks. For
just at the time when the Athenians were entering into the Hellenic
body, the Pelasgi came to live with them in their country, whence it
was that the latter came first to be regarded as Greeks. Whoever has
been initiated into the mysteries of the Cabiri will understand what I
mean. The Samothracians received these mysteries from the Pelasgi,
who, before they went to live in Attica, were dwellers in
Samothrace, and imparted their religious ceremonies to the
inhabitants. The Athenians, then, who were the first of all the Greeks
to make their statues of Mercury in this way, learnt the practice from
the Pelasgians; and by this people a religious account of the matter
is given, which is explained in the Samothracian mysteries.</p>
<p id="passage-54"><a href="#passage-54" class="passage-id">54</a> In early times the Pelasgi, as I know by information which I got
at Dodona, offered sacrifices of all kinds, and prayed to the gods,
but had no distinct names or appellations for them, since they had
never heard of any. They called them gods (Theoi, disposers),
because they disposed and arranged all things in such a beautiful
order. After a long lapse of time the names of the gods came to Greece
from Egypt, and the Pelasgi learnt them, only as yet they knew nothing
of Bacchus, of whom they first heard at a much later date. Not long
after the arrival of the names they sent to consult the oracle at
Dodona about them. This is the most ancient oracle in Greece, and at
that time there was no other. To their question, "Whether they
should adopt the names that had been imported from the foreigners?"
the oracle replied by recommending their use. Thenceforth in their
sacrifices the Pelasgi made use of the names of the gods, and from
them the names passed afterwards to the Greeks.</p>
<p id="passage-55"><a href="#passage-55" class="passage-id">55</a> Whence the gods severally sprang, whether or no they had all
existed from eternity, what forms they bore- these are questions of
which the Greeks knew nothing until the other day, so to speak. For
Homer and Hesiod were the first to compose Theogonies, and give the
gods their epithets, to allot them their several offices and
occupations, and describe their forms; and they lived but four hundred
years before my time, as I believe. As for the poets who are thought
by some to be earlier than these, they are, in my judgment,
decidedly later writers. In these matters I have the authority of
the priestesses of Dodona for the former portion of my statements;
what I have said of Homer and Hesiod is my own opinion.</p>
<p id="passage-56"><a href="#passage-56" class="passage-id">56</a> The following tale is commonly told in Egypt concerning the oracle
of Dodona in Greece, and that of Ammon in Libya. My informants on
the point were the priests of Jupiter at Thebes. They said "that two
of the sacred women were once carried off from Thebes by the
Phoenicians, and that the story went that one of them was sold into
Libya, and the other into Greece, and these women were the first
founders of the oracles in the two countries." On my inquiring how
they came to know so exactly what became of the women, they
answered, "that diligent search had been made after them at the
time, but that it had not been found possible to discover where they
were; afterwards, however, they received the information which they
had given me."</p>
<p id="passage-57"><a href="#passage-57" class="passage-id">57</a> This was what I heard from the priests at Thebes; at Dodona,
however, the women who deliver the oracles relate the matter as
follows:- "Two black doves flew away from Egyptian Thebes, and while
one directed its flight to Libya, the other came to them. She alighted
on an oak, and sitting there began to speak with a human voice, and
told them that on the spot where she was, there should henceforth be
an oracle of Jove. They understood the announcement to be from heaven,
so they set to work at once and erected the shrine. The dove which
flew to Libya bade the Libyans to establish there the oracle of
Ammon." This likewise is an oracle of Jupiter. The persons from whom I
received these particulars were three priestesses of the Dodonaeans,
the eldest Promeneia, the next Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra-
what they said was confirmed by the other Dodonaeans who dwell
around the temple.</p>
<p id="passage-58"><a href="#passage-58" class="passage-id">58</a> My own opinion of these matters is as follows:- I think that, if
it be true that the Phoenicians carried off the holy women, and sold
them for slaves, the one into Libya and the other into Greece, or
Pelasgia (as it was then called), this last must have been sold to the
Thesprotians. Afterwards, while undergoing servitude in those parts,
she built under a real oak a temple to Jupiter, her thoughts in her
new abode reverting- as it was likely they would do, if she had been
an attendant in a temple of Jupiter at Thebes- to that particular god.
Then, having acquired a knowledge of the Greek tongue, she set up an
oracle. She also mentioned that her sister had been sold for a slave
into Libya by the same persons as herself.</p>
<p id="passage-59"><a href="#passage-59" class="passage-id">59</a> The Dodonaeans called the women doves because they were
foreigners, and seemed to them to make a noise like birds. After a
while the dove spoke with a human voice, because the woman, whose
foreign talk had previously sounded to them like the chattering of a
bird, acquired the power of speaking what they could understand. For
how can it be conceived possible that a dove should really speak
with the voice of a man? Lastly, by calling the dove black the
Dodonaeans indicated that the woman was an Egyptian. And certainly the
character of the oracles at Thebes and Dodona is very similar. Besides
this form of divination, the Greeks learnt also divination by means of
victims from the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="passage-60"><a href="#passage-60" class="passage-id">60</a> The Egyptians were also the first to introduce solemn
assemblies, processions, and litanies to the gods; of all which the
Greeks were taught the use by them. It seems to me a sufficient
proof of this that in Egypt these practices have been established from
remote antiquity, while in Greece they are only recently known.</p>
<p id="passage-61"><a href="#passage-61" class="passage-id">61</a> The Egyptians do not hold a single solemn assembly, but several in
the course of the year. Of these the chief, which is better attended
than any other, is held at the city of Bubastis in honour of Diana.
The next in importance is that which takes place at Busiris, a city
situated in the very middle of the Delta; it is in honour of Isis, who
is called in the Greek tongue Demiter (Ceres). There is a third
great festival in Sais to Minerva, a fourth in Heliopolis to the
Sun, a fifth in Buto to Latona, and a sixth in Papremis to Mars.</p>
<p id="passage-62"><a href="#passage-62" class="passage-id">62</a> The following are the proceedings on occasion of the assembly at
Bubastis:- Men and women come sailing all together, vast numbers in
each boat, many of the women with castanets, which they strike,
while some of the men pipe during the whole time of the voyage; the
remainder of the voyagers, male and female, sing the while, and make a
clapping with their hands. When they arrive opposite any of the
towns upon the banks of the stream, they approach the shore, and,
while some of the women continue to play and sing, others call aloud
to the females of the place and load them with abuse, while a
certain number dance, and some standing up uncover themselves. After
proceeding in this way all along the river-course, they reach
Bubastis, where they celebrate the feast with abundant sacrifices.
More grape-wine is consumed at this festival than in all the rest of
the year besides. The number of those who attend, counting only the
men and women and omitting the children, amounts, according to the
native reports, to seven hundred thousand.</p>
<p id="passage-63"><a href="#passage-63" class="passage-id">63</a> The ceremonies at the feast of Isis in the city of Busiris have
been already spoken of. It is there that the whole multitude, both
of men and women, many thousands in number, beat themselves at the
close of the sacrifice, in honour of a god, whose name a religious
scruple forbids me to mention. The Carian dwellers in Egypt proceed on
this occasion to still greater lengths, even cutting their faces
with their knives, whereby they let it been seen that they are not
Egyptians but foreigners.</p>
<p id="passage-64"><a href="#passage-64" class="passage-id">64</a> At Sais, when the assembly takes place for the sacrifices, there
is one night on which the inhabitants all burn a multitude of lights
in the open air round their houses. They use lamps in the shape of
flat saucers filled with a mixture of oil and salt, on the top of
which the wick floats. These burn the whole night, and give to the
festival the name of the Feast of Lamps. The Egyptians who are
absent from the festival observe the night of the sacrifice, no less
than the rest, by a general lighting of lamps; so that the
illumination is not confined to the city of Sais, but extends over the
whole of Egypt. And there is a religious reason assigned for the
special honour paid to this night, as well as for the illumination
which accompanies it.</p>
<p id="passage-65"><a href="#passage-65" class="passage-id">65</a> At Heliopolis and Buto the assemblies are merely for the purpose
of sacrifice; but at Papremis, besides the sacrifices and other
rites which are performed there as elsewhere, the following custom
is observed:- When the sun is getting low, a few only of the priests
continue occupied about the image of the god, while the greater
number, armed with wooden clubs, take their station at the portal of
the temple. Opposite to them is drawn up a body of men, in number
above a thousand, armed, like the others, with clubs, consisting of
persons engaged in the performance of their vows. The image of the
god, which is kept in a small wooden shrine covered with plates of
gold, is conveyed from the temple into a second sacred building the
day before the festival begins. The few priests still in attendance
upon the image place it, together with the shrine containing it, on
a four-wheeled car, and begin to drag it along; the others stationed
at the gateway of the temple, oppose its admission. Then the
votaries come forward to espouse the quarrel of the god, and set
upon the opponents, who are sure to offer resistance. A sharp fight
with clubs ensues, in which heads are commonly broken on both sides.
Many, I am convinced, die of the wounds that they receive, though
the Egyptians insist that no one is ever killed.</p>
<p id="passage-66"><a href="#passage-66" class="passage-id">66</a> The natives give the subjoined account of this festival. They
say that the mother of the god Mars once dwelt in the temple.
Brought up at a distance from his parent, when he grew to man's estate
he conceived a wish to visit her. Accordingly he came, but the
attendants, who had never seen him before, refused him entrance, and
succeeded in keeping him out. So he went to another city and collected
a body of men, with whose aid he handled the attendants very
roughly, and forced his way in to his mother. Hence they say arose the
custom of a fight with sticks in honour of Mars at this festival.</p>
<p id="passage-67"><a href="#passage-67" class="passage-id">67</a> The Egyptians first made it a point of religion to have no
converse with women in the sacred places, and not to enter them
without washing, after such converse. Almost all other nations, except
the Greeks and the Egyptians, act differently, regarding man as in
this matter under no other law than the brutes. Many animals, they
say, and various kinds of birds, may be seen to couple in the
temples and the sacred precincts, which would certainly not happen
if the gods were displeased at it. Such are the arguments by which
they defend their practice, but I nevertheless can by no means approve
of it. In these points the Egyptians are specially careful, as they
are indeed in everything which concerns their sacred edifices.</p>
<p id="passage-68"><a href="#passage-68" class="passage-id">68</a> Egypt, though it borders upon Libya, is not a region abounding
in wild animals. The animals that do exist in the country, whether
domesticated or otherwise, are all regarded as sacred. If I were to
explain why they are consecrated to the several gods, I should be
led to speak of religious matters, which I particularly shrink from
mentioning; the points whereon I have touched slightly hitherto have
all been introduced from sheer necessity. Their custom with respect to
animals is as follows:- For every kind there are appointed certain
guardians, some male, some female, whose business it is to look
after them; and this honour is made to descend from father to son. The
inhabitants of the various cities, when they have made a vow to any
god, pay it to his animals in the way which I will now explain. At the
time of making the vow they shave the head of the child, cutting off
all the hair, or else half, or sometimes a third part, which they then
weigh in a balance against a sum of silver; and whatever sum the
hair weighs is presented to the guardian of the animals, who thereupon
cuts up some fish, and gives it to them for food- such being the stuff
whereon they are fed. When a man has killed one of the sacred animals,
if he did it with malice prepense, he is punished with death; if
unwittingly, he has to pay such a fine as the priests choose to
impose. When an ibis, however, or a hawk is killed, whether it was
done by accident or on purpose, the man must needs die.</p>
<p id="passage-69"><a href="#passage-69" class="passage-id">69</a> The number of domestic animals in Egypt is very great, and would
be still greater were it not for what befalls the cats. As the
females, when they have kittened, no longer seek the company of the
males, these last, to obtain once more their companionship, practise a
curious artifice. They seize the kittens, carry them off, and kill
them, but do not cat them afterwards. Upon this the females, being
deprived of their young, and longing to supply their place, seek the
males once more, since they are particularly fond of their
offspring. On every occasion of a fire in Egypt the strangest
prodigy occurs with the cats. The inhabitants allow the fire to rage
as it pleases, while they stand about at intervals and watch these
animals, which, slipping by the men or else leaping over them, rush
headlong into the flames. When this happens, the Egyptians are in deep
affliction. If a cat dies in a private house by a natural death, all
the inmates of the house shave their eyebrows; on the death of a dog
they shave the head and the whole of the body.</p>
<p id="passage-70"><a href="#passage-70" class="passage-id">70</a> The cats on their decease are taken to the city of Bubastis, where
they are embalmed, after which they are buried in certain sacred
repositories. The dogs are interred in the cities to which they
belong, also in sacred burial-places. The same practice obtains with
respect to the ichneumons; the hawks and shrew-mice, on the
contrary, are conveyed to the city of Buto for burial, and the
ibises to Hermopolis. The bears, which are scarce in Egypt, and the
wolves, which are not much bigger than foxes, they bury wherever
they happen to find them lying.</p>
<p id="passage-71"><a href="#passage-71" class="passage-id">71</a> The following are the peculiarities of the crocodile:- During
the four winter months they eat nothing; they are four-footed, and
live indifferently on land or in the water. The female lays and
hatches her eggs ashore, passing the greater portion of the day on dry
land, but at night retiring to the river, the water of which is warmer
than the night-air and the dew. Of all known animals this is the one
which from the smallest size grows to be the greatest: for the egg
of the crocodile is but little bigger than that of the goose, and
the young crocodile is in proportion to the egg; yet when it is full
grown, the animal measures frequently seventeen cubits and even
more. It has the eyes of a pig, teeth large and tusk-like, of a size
proportioned to its frame; unlike any other animal, it is without a
tongue; it cannot move its under-jaw, and in this respect too it is
singular, being the only animal in the world which moves the upper-jaw
but not the under. It has strong claws and a scaly skin,
impenetrable upon the back. In the water it is blind, but on land it
is very keen of sight. As it lives chiefly in the river, it has the
inside of its mouth constantly covered with leeches; hence it
happens that, while all the other birds and beasts avoid it, with
the trochilus it lives at peace, since it owes much to that bird:
for the crocodile, when he leaves the water and comes out upon the
land, is in the habit of lying with his mouth wide open, facing the
western breeze: at such times the trochilus goes into his mouth and
devours the leeches. This benefits the crocodile, who is pleased,
and takes care not to hurt the trochilus.</p>
<p id="passage-72"><a href="#passage-72" class="passage-id">72</a> The crocodile is esteemed sacred by some of the Egyptians, by
others he is treated as an enemy. Those who live near Thebes, and
those who dwell around Lake Moeris, regard them with especial
veneration. In each of these places they keep one crocodile in
particular, who is taught to be tame and tractable. They adorn his
ears with ear-rings of molten stone or gold, and put bracelets on
his fore-paws, giving him daily a set portion of bread, with a certain
number of victims; and, after having thus treated him with the
greatest possible attention while alive, they embalm him when he
dies and bury him in a sacred repository. The people of Elephantine on
the other hand, are so far from considering these animals as sacred
that they even eat their flesh. In the Egyptian language they are
not called crocodiles, but Champsae. The name of crocodiles was
given them by the Ionians, who remarked their resemblance to the
lizards, which in Ionia live in the walls and are called crocodiles.</p>
<p id="passage-73"><a href="#passage-73" class="passage-id">73</a> The modes of catching the crocodile are many and various. I
shall only describe the one which seems to me most worthy of
mention. They bait a hook with a chine of pork and let the meat be
carried out into the middle of the stream, while the hunter upon the
bank holds a living pig, which he belabours. The crocodile hears its
cries, and making for the sound, encounters the pork, which he
instantly swallows down. The men on the shore haul, and when they have
got him to land, the first thing the hunter does is to plaster his
eyes with mud. This once accomplished, the animal is despatched with
ease, otherwise he gives great trouble.</p>
<p id="passage-74"><a href="#passage-74" class="passage-id">74</a> The hippopotamus, in the canton of Papremis, is a sacred animal,
but not in any other part of Egypt. It may be thus described:- It is a
quadruped, cloven-footed, with hoofs like an ox, and a flat nose. It
has the mane and tail of a horse, huge tusks which are very
conspicuous, and a voice like a horse's neigh. In size it equals the
biggest oxen, and its skin is so tough that when dried it is made into
javelins.</p>
<p id="passage-75"><a href="#passage-75" class="passage-id">75</a> Otters also are found in the Nile, and are considered sacred. Only
two sorts of fish are venerated, that called the lepidotus and the
eel. These are regarded as sacred to the Nile, as likewise among birds
is the vulpanser, or fox-goose.</p>
<p id="passage-76"><a href="#passage-76" class="passage-id">76</a> They have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I
myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great
rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of
the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old
phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are
as follow:- The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the
general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They
tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be
credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent
bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and
there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms
a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he
hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he
covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of
exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt,
plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the
Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.</p>
<p id="passage-77"><a href="#passage-77" class="passage-id">77</a> In the neighbourhood of Thebes there are some sacred serpents
which are perfectly harmless. They are of small size, and have two
horns growing out of the top of the head. These snakes, when they die,
are buried in the temple of Jupiter, the god to whom they are sacred.</p>
<p id="passage-78"><a href="#passage-78" class="passage-id">78</a> I went once to a certain place in Arabia, almost exactly
opposite the city of Buto, to make inquiries concerning the winged
serpents. On my arrival I saw the back-bones and ribs of serpents in
such numbers as it is impossible to describe: of the ribs there were a
multitude of heaps, some great, some small, some middle-sized. The
place where the bones lie is at the entrance of a narrow gorge between
steep mountains, which there open upon a spacious plain
communicating with the great plain of Egypt. The story goes that
with the spring the winged snakes come flying from Arabia towards
Egypt, but are met in this gorge by the birds called ibises, who
forbid their entrance and destroy them all. The Arabians assert, and
the Egyptians also admit, that it is on account of the service thus
rendered that the Egyptians hold the ibis in so much reverence.</p>
<p id="passage-79"><a href="#passage-79" class="passage-id">79</a> The ibis is a bird of a deep-black colour, with legs like a crane;
its beak is strongly hooked, and its size is about that of the
land-rail. This is a description of the black ibis which contends with
the serpents. The commoner sort, for there are two quite distinct
species, has the head and the whole throat bare of feathers; its
general plumage is white, but the head and neck are jet black, as also
are the tips of the wings and the extremity of the tail; in its beak
and legs it resembles the other species. The winged serpent is
shaped like the water-snake. Its wings are not feathered, but resemble
very closely those of the bat. And thus I conclude the subject of
the sacred animals.</p>
<p id="passage-80"><a href="#passage-80" class="passage-id">80</a> With respect to the Egyptians themselves, it is to be remarked
that those who live in the corn country, devoting themselves, as
they do, far more than any other people in the world, to the
preservation of the memory of past actions, are the best skilled in
history of any men that I have ever met. The following is the mode
of life habitual to them:- For three successive days in each month
they purge the body by means of emetics and clysters, which is done
out of a regard for their health, since they have a persuasion that
every disease to which men are liable is occasioned by the
substances whereon they feed. Apart from any such precautions, they
are, I believe, next to the Libyans, the healthiest people in the
world- an effect of their climate, in my opinion, which has no
sudden changes. Diseases almost always attack men when they are
exposed to a change, and never more than during changes of the
weather. They live on bread made of spelt, which they form into loaves
called in their own tongue cyllestis. Their drink is a wine which they
obtain from barley, as they have no vines in their country. Many kinds
of fish they eat raw, either salted or dried in the sun. Quails
also, and ducks and small birds, they eat uncooked, merely first
salting them. All other birds and fishes, excepting those which are
set apart as sacred, are eaten either roasted or boiled.</p>
<p id="passage-81"><a href="#passage-81" class="passage-id">81</a> In social meetings among the rich, when the banquet is ended, a
servant carries round to the several guests a coffin, in which there
is a wooden image of a corpse, carved and painted to resemble nature
as nearly as possible, about a cubit or two cubits in length. As he
shows it to each guest in turn, the servant says, "Gaze here, and
drink and be merry; for when you die, such will you be."</p>
<p id="passage-82"><a href="#passage-82" class="passage-id">82</a> The Egyptians adhere to their own national customs, and adopt no
foreign usages. Many of these customs are worthy of note: among others
their song, the Linus, which is sung under various names not only in
Egypt but in Phoenicia, in Cyprus, and in other places; and which
seems to be exactly the same as that in use among the Greeks, and by
them called Linus. There were very many things in Egypt which filled
me with astonishment, and this was one of them. Whence could the
Egyptians have got the Linus? It appears to have been sung by them
from the very earliest times. For the Linus in Egyptian is called
Maneros; and they told me that Maneros was the only son of their first
king, and that on his untimely death he was honoured by the
Egyptians with these dirgelike strains, and in this way they got their
first and only melody.</p>
<p id="passage-83"><a href="#passage-83" class="passage-id">83</a> There is another custom in which the Egyptians resemble a
particular Greek people, namely the Lacedaemonians. Their young men,
when they meet their elders in the streets, give way to them and
step aside; and if an elder come in where young men are present, these
latter rise from their seats. In a third point they differ entirely
from all the nations of Greece. Instead of speaking to each other when
they meet in the streets, they make an obeisance, sinking the hand
to the knee.</p>
<p id="passage-84"><a href="#passage-84" class="passage-id">84</a> They wear a linen tunic fringed about the legs, and called
calasiris; over this they have a white woollen garment thrown on
afterwards. Nothing of woollen, however, is taken into their temples
or buried with them, as their religion forbids it. Here their practice
resembles the rites called Orphic and Bacchic, but which are in
reality Egyptian and Pythagorean; for no one initiated in these
mysteries can be buried in a woollen shroud, a religious reason
being assigned for the observance.</p>
<p id="passage-85"><a href="#passage-85" class="passage-id">85</a> The Egyptians likewise discovered to which of the gods each
month and day is sacred; and found out from the day of a man's birth
what he will meet with in the course of his life, and how he will
end his days, and what sort of man he will be- discoveries whereof the
Greeks engaged in poetry have made a use. The Egyptians have also
discovered more prognostics than all the rest of mankind besides.
Whenever a prodigy takes place, they watch and record the result;
then, if anything similar ever happens again, they expect the same
consequences.</p>
<p id="passage-86"><a href="#passage-86" class="passage-id">86</a> With respect to divination, they hold that it is a gift which no
mortal possesses, but only certain of the gods: thus they have an
oracle of Hercules, one of Apollo, of Minerva, of Diana, of Mars,
and of Jupiter. Besides these, there is the oracle of Latona at
Buto, which is held in much higher repute than any of the rest. The
mode of delivering the oracles is not uniform, but varies at the
different shrines.</p>
<p id="passage-87"><a href="#passage-87" class="passage-id">87</a> Medicine is practised among them on a plan of separation; each
physician treats a single disorder, and no more: thus the country
swarms with medical practitioners, some undertaking to cure diseases
of the eye, others of the head, others again of the teeth, others of
the intestines, and some those which are not local.</p>
<p id="passage-88"><a href="#passage-88" class="passage-id">88</a> The following is the way in which they conduct their mournings and
their funerals:- On the death in any house of a man of consequence,
forthwith the women of the family beplaster their heads, and sometimes
even their faces, with mud; and then, leaving the body indoors,
sally forth and wander through the city, with their dress fastened
by a band, and their bosoms bare, beating themselves as they walk. All
the female relations join them and do the same. The men too, similarly
begirt, beat their breasts separately. When these ceremonies are over,
the body is carried away to be embalmed.</p>
<p id="passage-89"><a href="#passage-89" class="passage-id">89</a> There are a set of men in Egypt who practice the art of embalming,
and make it their proper business. These persons, when a body is
brought to them, show the bearers various models of corpses, made in
wood, and painted so as to resemble nature. The most perfect is said
to be after the manner of him whom I do not think it religious to name
in connection with such a matter; the second sort is inferior to the
first, and less costly; the third is the cheapest of all. All this the
embalmers explain, and then ask in which way it is wished that the
corpse should be prepared. The bearers tell them, and having concluded
their bargain, take their departure, while the embalmers, left to
themselves, proceed to their task. The mode of embalming, according to
the most perfect process, is the following:- They take first a crooked
piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils,
thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared of the
rest by rinsing with drugs; next they make a cut along the flank
with a sharp Ethiopian stone, and take out the whole contents of the
abdomen, which they then cleanse, washing it thoroughly with palm
wine, and again frequently with an infusion of pounded aromatics.
After this they fill the cavity with the purest bruised myrrh, with
cassia, and every other sort of spicery except frankincense, and sew
up the opening. Then the body is placed in natrum for seventy days,
and covered entirely over. After the expiration of that space of time,
which must not be exceeded, the body is washed, and wrapped round,
from head to foot, with bandages of fine linen cloth, smeared over
with gum, which is used generally by the Egyptians in the place of
glue, and in this state it is given back to the relations, who enclose
it in a wooden case which they have had made for the purpose, shaped
into the figure of a man. Then fastening the case, they place it in
a sepulchral chamber, upright against the wall. Such is the most
costly way of embalming the dead.</p>
<p id="passage-90"><a href="#passage-90" class="passage-id">90</a> If persons wish to avoid expense, and choose the second process,
the following is the method pursued:- Syringes are filled with oil
made from the cedar-tree, which is then, without any incision or
disembowelling, injected into the abdomen. The passage by which it
might be likely to return is stopped, and the body laid in natrum
the prescribed number of days. At the end of the time the cedar-oil is
allowed to make its escape; and such is its power that it brings
with it the whole stomach and intestines in a liquid state. The natrum
meanwhile has dissolved the flesh, and so nothing is left of the
dead body but the skin and the bones. It is returned in this condition
to the relatives, without any further trouble being bestowed upon it.</p>
<p id="passage-91"><a href="#passage-91" class="passage-id">91</a> The third method of embalming, which is practised in the case of
the poorer classes, is to clear out the intestines with a clyster, and
let the body lie in natrum the seventy days, after which it is at once
given to those who come to fetch it away.</p>
<p id="passage-92"><a href="#passage-92" class="passage-id">92</a> The wives of men of rank are not given to be embalmed
immediately after death, nor indeed are any of the more beautiful
and valued women. It is not till they have been dead three or four
days that they are carried to the embalmers. This is done to prevent
indignities from being offered them. It is said that once a case of
this kind occurred: the man was detected by the information of his
fellow-workman.</p>
<p id="passage-93"><a href="#passage-93" class="passage-id">93</a> Whensoever any one, Egyptian or foreigner, has lost his life by
falling a prey to a crocodile, or by drowning in the river, the law
compels the inhabitants of the city near which the body is cast up
to have it embalmed, and to bury it in one of the sacred
repositories with all possible magnificence. No one may touch the
corpse, not even any of the friends or relatives, but only the priests
of the Nile, who prepare it for burial with their own hands- regarding
it as something more than the mere body of a man- and themselves lay
it in the tomb.</p>
<p id="passage-94"><a href="#passage-94" class="passage-id">94</a> The Egyptians are averse to adopt Greek customs, or, in a word,
those of any other nation. This feeling is almost universal among
them. At Chemmis, however, which is a large city in the Thebaic
canton, near Neapolis, there is a square enclosure sacred to
Perseus, son of Danae. Palm trees grow all round the place, which
has a stone gateway of an unusual size, surmounted by two colossal
statues, also in stone. Inside this precinct is a temple, and in the
temple an image of Perseus. The people of Chemmis say that Perseus
often appears to them, sometimes within the sacred enclosure,
sometimes in the open country: one of the sandals which he has worn is
frequently found- two cubits in length, as they affirm- and then all
Egypt flourishes greatly. In the worship of Perseus Greek ceremonies
are used; gymnastic games are celebrated in his honour, comprising
every kind of contest, with prizes of cattle, cloaks, and skins. I
made inquiries of the Chemmites why it was that Perseus appeared to
them and not elsewhere in Egypt, and how they came to celebrate
gymnastic contests unlike the rest of the Egyptians: to which they
answered, "that Perseus belonged to their city by descent. Danans
and Lynceus were Chemmites before they set sail for Greece, and from
them Perseus was descended," they said, tracing the genealogy; "and
he, when he came to Egypt for the purpose" (which the Greeks also
assign) "of bringing away from Libya the Gorgon's head, paid them a
visit, and acknowledged them for his kinsmen- he had heard the name of
their city from his mother before he left Greece- he bade them
institute a gymnastic contest in his honour, and that was the reason
why they observed the practice."</p>
<p id="passage-95"><a href="#passage-95" class="passage-id">95</a> The customs hitherto described are those of the Egyptians who live
above the marsh-country. The inhabitants of the marshes have the
same customs as the rest, as well in those matters which have been
mentioned above as in respect of marriage, each Egyptian taking to
himself, like the Greeks, a single wife; but for greater cheapness
of living the marsh-men practise certain peculiar customs, such as
these following. They gather the blossoms of a certain water-lily,
which grows in great abundance all over the flat country at the time
when the Nile rises and floods the regions along its banks- the
Egyptians call it lotus- they gather, I say, the blossoms of this
plant and dry them in the sun, after which they extract from the
centre of each blossom a substance like the head of a poppy, which
they crush and make into bread. The root of the lotus is likewise
eatable, and has a pleasant sweet taste: it is round, and about the
size of an apple. There is also another species of the lily in
Egypt, which grows, like the lotus, in the river, and resembles the
rose. The fruit springs up side by side with the blossom, on a
separate stalk, and has almost exactly the look of the comb made by
wasps. It contains a number of seeds, about the size of an
olive-stone, which are good to eat: and these are eaten both green and
dried. The byblus (papyrus), which grows year after year in the
marshes, they pull up, and, cutting the plant in two, reserve the
upper portion for other purposes, but take the lower, which is about a
cubit long, and either eat it or else sell it. Such as wish to enjoy
the byblus in full perfection bake it first in a closed vessel, heated
to a glow. Some of these folk, however, live entirely on fish, which
are gutted as soon as caught, and then hung up in the sun: when dry,
they are used as food.</p>
<p id="passage-96"><a href="#passage-96" class="passage-id">96</a> Gregarious fish are not found in any numbers in the rivers; they
frequent the lagunes, whence, at the season of breeding, they
proceed in shoals towards the sea. The males lead the way, and drop
their milt as they go, while the females, following close behind,
eagerly swallow it down. From this they conceive, and when, after
passing some time in the sea, they begin to be in spawn, the whole
shoal sets off on its return to its ancient haunts. Now, however, it
is no longer the males, but the females, who take the lead: they
swim in front in a body, and do exactly as the males did before,
dropping, little by little, their grains of spawn as they go, while
the males in the rear devour the grains, each one of which is a
fish. A portion of the spawn escapes and is not swallowed by the
males, and hence come the fishes which grow afterwards to maturity.
Whan any of this sort of fish are taken on their passage to the sea,
they are found to have the left side of the head scarred and
bruised; while if taken on their return, the marks appear on the
right. The reason is that as they swim down the Nile seaward, they
keep close to the bank of the river upon their left, and returning
again up stream they still cling to the same side, hugging it and
brushing against it constantly, to be sure that they miss not their
road through the great force of the current. When the Nile begins to
rise, the hollows in the land and the marshy spots near the river
are flooded before any other places by the percolation of the water
through the riverbanks; and these, almost as soon as they become
pools, are found to be full of numbers of little fishes. I think
that I understand how it is this comes to pass. On the subsidence of
the Nile the year before, though the fish retired with the
retreating waters, they had first deposited their spawn in the mud
upon the banks; and so, when at the usual season the water returns,
small fry are rapidly engendered out of the spawn of the preceding
year. So much concerning the fish.</p>
<p id="passage-97"><a href="#passage-97" class="passage-id">97</a> The Egyptians who live in the marshes use for the anointing of
their bodies an oil made from the fruit of the sillicyprium, which
is known among them by the name of "kiki." To obtain this they plant
the sillicyprium (which grows wild in Greece) along the banks of the
rivers and by the sides of the lakes, where it produces fruit in great
abundance, but with a very disagreeable smell. This fruit is gathered,
and then bruised and pressed, or else boiled down after roasting:
the liquid which comes from it is collected and is found to be
unctuous, and as well suited as olive-oil for lamps, only that it
gives out an unpleasant odour.</p>
<p id="passage-98"><a href="#passage-98" class="passage-id">98</a> The contrivances which they use against gnats, wherewith the
country swarms, are the following. In the parts of Egypt above the
marshes the inhabitants pass the night upon lofty towers, which are of
great service, as the gnats are unable to fly to any height on account
of the winds. In the marsh-country, where there are no towers, each
man possesses a net instead. By day it serves him to catch fish, while
at night he spreads it over the bed in which he is to rest, and
creeping in, goes to sleep underneath. The gnats, which, if he rolls
himself up in his dress or in a piece of muslin, are sure to bite
through the covering, do not so much as attempt to pass the net.</p>
<p id="passage-99"><a href="#passage-99" class="passage-id">99</a> The vessels used in Egypt for the transport of merchandise are
made of the Acantha (Thorn), a tree which in its growth is very like
the Cyrenaic lotus, and from which there exudes a gum. They cut a
quantity of planks about two cubits in length from this tree, and then
proceed to their ship-building, arranging the planks like bricks,
and attaching them by ties to a number of long stakes or poles till
the hull is complete, when they lay the cross-planks on the top from
side to side. They give the boats no ribs, but caulk the seams with
papyrus on the inside. Each has a single rudder, which is driven
straight through the keel. The mast is a piece of acantha-wood, and
the sails are made of papyrus. These boats cannot make way against the
current unless there is a brisk breeze; they are, therefore, towed
up-stream from the shore: down-stream they are managed as follows.
There is a raft belonging to each, made of the wood of the tamarisk,
fastened together with a wattling of reeds; and also a stone bored
through the middle about two talents in weight. The raft is fastened
to the vessel by a rope, and allowed to float down the stream in
front, while the stone is attached by another rope astern. The
result is that the raft, hurried forward by the current, goes
rapidly down the river, and drags the "baris" (for so they call this
sort of boat) after it; while the stone, which is pulled along in
the wake of the vessel, and lies deep in the water, keeps the boat
straight. There are a vast number of these vessels in Egypt, and
some of them are of many thousand talents' burthen.</p>
<p id="passage-100"><a href="#passage-100" class="passage-id">100</a> When the Nile overflows, the country is converted into a sea,
and nothing appears but the cities, which look like the islands in the
Egean. At this season boats no longer keep the course of the river,
but sail right across the plain. On the voyage from Naucratis to
Memphis at this season, you pass close to the pyramids, whereas the
usual course is by the apex of the Delta, and the city of
Cercasorus. You can sail also from the maritime town of Canobus across
the flat to Naucratis, passing by the cities of Anthylla and
Archandropolis.</p>
<p id="passage-101"><a href="#passage-101" class="passage-id">101</a> The former of these cities, which is a place of note, is
assigned expressly to the wife of the ruler of Egypt for the time
being, to keep her in shoes. Such has been the custom ever since Egypt
fell under the Persian yoke. The other city seems to me to have got
its name of Archandropolis from Archander the Phthian, son of Achaeus,
and son-in-law of Danaus. There might certainly have been another
Archander; but, at any rate, the name is not Egyptian.</p>
<p id="passage-102"><a href="#passage-102" class="passage-id">102</a> Thus far I have spoken of Egypt from my own observation,
relating what I myself saw, the ideas that I formed, and the results
of my own researches. What follows rests on the accounts given me by
the Egyptians, which shall now repeat, adding thereto some particulars
which fell under by own notice.</p>
<p id="passage-103"><a href="#passage-103" class="passage-id">103</a> The priests said that Min was the first king of Egypt, and that it
was he who raised the dyke which protects Memphis from the inundations
of the Nile. Before his time the river flowed entirely along the sandy
range of hills which skirts Egypt on the side of Libya. He, however,
by banking up the river at the bend which it forms about a hundred
furlongs south of Memphis, laid the ancient channel dry, while he
dug a new course for the stream halfway between the two lines of
hills. To this day, the elbow which the Nile forms at the point
where it is forced aside into the new channel is guarded with the
greatest care by the Persians, and strengthened every year; for if the
river were to burst out at this place, and pour over the mound,
there would be danger of Memphis being completely overwhelmed by the
flood. Min, the first king, having thus, by turning the river, made
the tract where it used to run, dry land, proceeded in the first place
to build the city now called Memphis, which lies in the narrow part of
Egypt; after which he further excavated a lake outside the town, to
the north and west, communicating with the river, which was itself the
eastern boundary. Besides these works, he also, the priests said,
built the temple of Vulcan which stands within the city, a vast
edifice, very worthy of mention.</p>
<p id="passage-104"><a href="#passage-104" class="passage-id">104</a> Next, they read me from a papyrus the names of three hundred and
thirty monarchs, who (they said) were his successors upon the
throne. In this number of generations there were eighteen Ethiopian
kings, and one queen who was a native; all the rest were kings and
Egyptians. The queen bore the same name as the Babylonian princess,
namely, Nitocris. They said that she succeeded her brother; he had
been king of Egypt, and was put to death by his subjects, who then
placed her upon the throne. Bent on avenging his death, she devised
a cunning scheme by which she destroyed a vast number of Egyptians.
She constructed a spacious underground chamber, and, on pretence of
inaugurating it, contrived the following:- Inviting to a banquet those
of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had the chief share in the
murder of her brother, she suddenly, as they were feasting, let the
river in upon them by means of a secret duct of large size. This and
this only did they tell me of her, except that, when she had done as I
have said, she threw herself into an apartment full of ashes, that she
might escape the vengeance whereto she would otherwise have been
exposed.</p>
<p id="passage-105"><a href="#passage-105" class="passage-id">105</a> The other kings, they said, were personages of no note or
distinction, and left no monuments of any account, with the
exception of the last, who was named Moeris. He left several memorials
of his reign- the northern gateway of the temple of Vulcan, the lake
excavated by his orders, whose dimensions I shall give presently,
and the pyramids built by him in the lake, the size of which will be
stated when I describe the lake itself wherein they stand. Such were
his works: the other kings left absolutely nothing.</p>
<p id="passage-106"><a href="#passage-106" class="passage-id">106</a> Passing over these monarchs, therefore, I shall speak of the
king who reigned next, whose name was Sesostris. He, the priests said,
first of all proceeded in a fleet of ships of war from the Arabian
gulf along the shores of the Erythraean sea, subduing the nations as
he went, until he finally reached a sea which could not be navigated
by reason of the shoals. Hence he returned to Egypt, where, they
told me, he collected a vast armament, and made a progress by land
across the continent, conquering every people which fell in his way.
In the countries where the natives withstood his attack, and fought
gallantly for their liberties, he erected pillars, on which he
inscribed his own name and country, and how that he had here reduced
the inhabitants to subjection by the might of his arms: where, on
the contrary, they submitted readily and without a struggle, he
inscribed on the pillars, in addition to these particulars, an
emblem to mark that they were a nation of women, that is, unwarlike
and effeminate.</p>
<p id="passage-107"><a href="#passage-107" class="passage-id">107</a> In this way he traversed the whole continent of Asia, whence he
passed on into Europe, and made himself master of Scythia and of
Thrace, beyond which countries I do not think that his army extended
its march. For thus far the pillars which he erected are still
visible, but in the remoter regions they are no longer found.
Returning to Egypt from Thrace, he came, on his way, to the banks of
the river Phasis. Here I cannot say with any certainty what took
place. Either he of his own accord detached a body of troops from
his main army and left them to colonise the country, or else a certain
number of his soldiers, wearied with their long wanderings,
deserted, and established themselves on the banks of this stream.</p>
<p id="passage-108"><a href="#passage-108" class="passage-id">108</a> There can be no doubt that the Colchians are an Egyptian race.
Before I heard any mention of the fact from others, I had remarked
it myself. After the thought had struck me, I made inquiries on the
subject both in Colchis and in Egypt, and I found that the Colchians
had a more distinct recollection of the Egyptians, than the
Egyptians had of them. Still the Egyptians said that they believed the
Colchians to be descended from the army of Sesostris. My own
conjectures were founded, first, on the fact that they are
black-skinned and have woolly hair, which certainly amounts to but
little, since several other nations are so too; but further and more
especially, on the circumstance that the Colchians, the Egyptians, and
the Ethiopians, are the only nations who have practised circumcision
from the earliest times. The Phoenicians and the Syrians of
Palestine themselves confess that they learnt the custom of the
Egyptians; and the Syrians who dwell about the rivers Thermodon and
Parthenius, as well as their neighbours the Macronians, say that
they have recently adopted it from the Colchians. Now these are the
only nations who use circumcision, and it is plain that they all
imitate herein the Egyptians. With respect to the Ethiopians,
indeed, I cannot decide whether they learnt the practice of the
Egyptians, or the Egyptians of them- it is undoubtedly of very ancient
date in Ethiopia- but that the others derived their knowledge of it
from Egypt is clear to me from the fact that the Phoenicians, when
they come to have commerce with the Greeks, cease to follow the
Egyptians in this custom, and allow their children to remain
uncircumcised.</p>
<p id="passage-109"><a href="#passage-109" class="passage-id">109</a> I will add a further proof to the identity of the Egyptians and
the Colchians. These two nations weave their linen in exactly the same
way, and this is a way entirely unknown to the rest of the world; they
also in their whole mode of life and in their language resemble one
another. The Colchian linen is called by the Greeks Sardinian, while
that which comes from Egypt is known as Egyptian.</p>
<p id="passage-110"><a href="#passage-110" class="passage-id">110</a> The pillars which Sesostris erected in the conquered countries
have for the most part disappeared; but in the part of Syria called
Palestine, I myself saw them still standing, with the writing
above-mentioned, and the emblem distinctly visible. In Ionia also,
there are two representations of this prince engraved upon rocks,
one on the road from Ephesus to Phocaea, the other between Sardis
and Smyrna. In each case the figure is that of a man, four cubits
and a span high, with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left,
the rest of his costume being likewise half Egyptian, half
Ethiopian. There is an inscription across the breast from shoulder
to shoulder, in the sacred character of Egypt, which says, "With my
own shoulders I conquered this land." The conqueror does not tell
who he is, or whence he comes, though elsewhere Sesostris records
these facts. Hence it has been imagined by some of those who have seen
these forms, that they are figures of Memnon; but such as think so err
very widely from the truth.</p>
<p id="passage-111"><a href="#passage-111" class="passage-id">111</a> This Sesostris, the priests went on to say, upon his return
home, accompanied by vast multitudes of the people whose countries
he had subdued, was received by his brother, whom he had made
viceroy of Egypt on his departure, at Daphnae near Pelusium, and
invited by him to a banquet, which he attended, together with his
sons. Then his brother piled a quantity of wood all round the
building, and having so done set it alight. Sesostris, discovering
what had happened, took counsel instantly with his wife, who had
accompanied him to the feast, and was advised by her to lay two of
their six sons upon the fire, and so make a bridge across the
flames, whereby the rest might effect their escape. Sesostris did as
she recommended, and thus while two of his sons were burnt to death,
he himself and his other children were saved.</p>
<p id="passage-112"><a href="#passage-112" class="passage-id">112</a> The king then returned to his own land and took vengeance upon his
brother, after which he proceeded to make use of the multitudes whom
he had brought with him from the conquered countries, partly to drag
the huge masses of stone which were moved in the course of his reign
to the temple of Vulcan- partly to dig the numerous canals with
which the whole of Egypt is intersected. By these forced labours the
entire face of the country was changed; for whereas Egypt had formerly
been a region suited both for horses and carriages, henceforth it
became entirely unfit for either. Though a flat country throughout its
whole extent, it is now unfit for either horse or carriage, being
cut up by the canals, which are extremely numerous and run in all
directions. The king's object was to supply Nile water to the
inhabitants of the towns situated in the mid-country, and not lying
upon the river; for previously they had been obliged, after the
subsidence of the floods, to drink a brackish water which they
obtained from wells.</p>
<p id="passage-113"><a href="#passage-113" class="passage-id">113</a> Sesostris also, they declared, made a division of the soil of
Egypt among the inhabitants, assigning square plots of ground of equal
size to all, and obtaining his chief revenue from the rent which the
holders were required to pay him year by year. If the river carried
away any portion of a man's lot, he appeared before the king, and
related what had happened; upon which the king sent persons to
examine, and determine by measurement the exact extent of the loss;
and thenceforth only such a rent was demanded of him as was
proportionate to the reduced size of his land. From this practice, I
think, geometry first came to be known in Egypt, whence it passed into
Greece. The sun-dial, however, and the gnomon with the division of the
day into twelve parts, were received by the Greeks from the
Babylonians.</p>
<p id="passage-114"><a href="#passage-114" class="passage-id">114</a> Sesostris was king not only of Egypt, but also of Ethiopia. He was
the only Egyptian monarch who ever ruled over the latter country. He
left, as memorials of his reign, the stone statues which stand in
front of the temple of Vulcan, two of which, representing himself
and his wife, are thirty cubits in height, while the remaining four,
which represent his sons, are twenty cubits. These are the statues, in
front of which the priest of Vulcan, very many years afterwards, would
not allow Darius the Persian to place a statue of himself;
"because," he said, "Darius had not equalled the achievements of
Sesostris the Egyptian: for while Sesostris had subdued to the full as
many nations as ever Darius had brought under, he had likewise
conquered the Scythians, whom Darius had failed to master. It was
not fair, therefore, that he should erect his statue in front of the
offerings of a king, whose deeds he had been unable to surpass."
Darius, they say, pardoned the freedom of this speech.</p>
<p id="passage-115"><a href="#passage-115" class="passage-id">115</a> On the death of Sesostris, his son Pheron, the priests said,
mounted the throne. He undertook no warlike expeditions; being
struck with blindness, owing to the following circumstance. The
river had swollen to the unusual height of eighteen cubits, and had
overflowed all the fields, when, a sudden wind arising, the water rose
in great waves. Then the king, in a spirit of impious violence, seized
his spear, and hurled it into the strong eddies of the stream.
Instantly he was smitten with disease of the eyes, from which after
a little while he became blind, continuing without the power of vision
for ten years. At last, in the eleventh year, an oracular announcement
reached him from the city of Buto, to the effect, that "the time of
his punishment had run out, and he should recover his sight by washing
his eyes with urine. He must find a woman who had been faithful to her
husband, and had never preferred to him another man." The king,
therefore, first of all made trial of his wife, but to no purpose he
continued as blind as before. So he made the experiment with other
women, until at length he succeeded, and in this way recovered his
sight. Hereupon he assembled all the women, except the last, and
bringing them to the city which now bears the name of Erythrabolus
(Red-soil), he there burnt them all, together with the place itself.
The woman to whom he owed his cure, he married, and after his recovery
was complete, he presented offerings to all the temples of any note,
among which the best worthy of mention are the two stone obelisks
which he gave to the temple of the Sun. These are magnificent works;
each is made of a single stone, eight cubits broad, and a hundred
cubits in height.</p>
<p id="passage-116"><a href="#passage-116" class="passage-id">116</a> Pheron, they said, was succeeded by a man of Memphis, whose
name, in the language of the Greeks, was Proteus. There is a sacred
precinct of this king in Memphis, which is very beautiful, and
richly adorned, situated south of the great temple of Vulcan.
Phoenicians from the city of Tyre dwell all round this precinct, and
the whole place is known by the name of "the camp of the Tyrians."
Within the enclosure stands a temple, which is called that of Venus
the Stranger. I conjecture the building to have been erected to Helen,
the daughter of Tyndarus; first, because she, as I have heard say,
passed some time at the court of Proteus; and secondly, because the
temple is dedicated to Venus the Stranger; for among all the many
temples of Venus there is no other where the goddess bears this title.</p>
<p id="passage-117"><a href="#passage-117" class="passage-id">117</a> The priests, in answer to my inquiries on the subject of Helen,
informed me of the following particulars. When Alexander had carried
off Helen from Sparta, he took ship and sailed homewards. On his way
across the Egean a gale arose, which drove him from his course and
took him down to the sea of Egypt; hence, as the wind did not abate,
he was carried on to the coast, when he went ashore, landing at the
Salt-Pans, in that mouth of the Nile which is now called the
Canobic. At this place there stood upon the shore a temple, which
still exists, dedicated to Hercules. If a slave runs away from his
master, and taking sanctuary at this shrine gives himself up to the
god, and receives certain sacred marks upon his person, whosoever
his master may be, he cannot lay hand on him. This law still
remained unchanged to my time. Hearing, therefore, of the custom of
the place, the attendants of Alexander deserted him, and fled to the
temple, where they sat as suppliants. While there, wishing to damage
their master, they accused him to the Egyptians, narrating all the
circumstances of the rape of Helen and the wrong done to Menelaus.
These charges they brought, not only before the priests, but also
before the warden of that mouth of the river, whose name was Thonis.</p>
<p id="passage-118"><a href="#passage-118" class="passage-id">118</a> As soon as he received the intelligence, Thonis sent a message
to Proteus, who was at Memphis, to this effect: "A stranger is arrived
from Greece; he is by race a Teucrian, and has done a wicked deed in
the country from which he is come. Having beguiled the wife of the man
whose guest he was, he carried her away with him, and much treasure
also. Compelled by stress of weather, he has now put in here. Are we
to let him depart as he came, or shall we seize what he has
brought?" Proteus replied, "Seize the man, be he who he may, that
has dealt thus wickedly with his friend, and bring him before me, that
I may hear what he will say for himself."</p>
<p id="passage-119"><a href="#passage-119" class="passage-id">119</a> Thonis, on receiving these orders, arrested Alexander, and stopped
the departure of his ships; then, taking with him Alexander, Helen,
the treasures, and also the fugitive slaves, he went up to Memphis.
When all were arrived, Proteus asked Alexander, "who he was, and
whence he had come?" Alexander replied by giving his descent, the name
of his country, and a true account of his late voyage. Then Proteus
questioned him as to how he got possession of Helen. In his reply
Alexander became confused, and diverged from the truth, whereon the
slaves interposed, confuted his statements, and told the whole history
of the crime. Finally, Proteus delivered judgment as follows: "Did I
not regard it as a matter of the utmost consequence that no stranger
driven to my country by adverse winds should ever be put to death, I
would certainly have avenged the Greek by slaying thee. Thou basest of
men,- after accepting hospitality, to do so wicked a deed! First, thou
didst seduce the wife of thy own host- then, not content therewith,
thou must violently excite her mind, and steal her away from her
husband. Nay, even so thou wert not satisfied, but on leaving, thou
must plunder the house in which thou hadst been a guest. Now then,
as I think it of the greatest importance to put no stranger to
death, I suffer thee to depart; but the woman and the treasures I
shall not permit to be carried away. Here they must stay, till the
Greek stranger comes in person and takes them back with him. For
thyself and thy companions, I command thee to begone from my land
within the space of three days- and I warn you, that otherwise at
the end of that time you will be treated as enemies."</p>
<p id="passage-120"><a href="#passage-120" class="passage-id">120</a> Such was the tale told me by the priests concerning the arrival of
Helen at the court of Proteus. It seems to me that Homer was
acquainted with this story, and while discarding it, because he
thought it less adapted for epic poetry than the version which he
followed, showed that it was not unknown to him. This is evident
from the travels which he assigns to Alexander in the Iliad- and let
it be borne in mind that he has nowhere else contradicted himself-
making him be carried out of his course on his return with Helen,
and after divers wanderings come at last to Sidon in Phoenicia. The
passage is in the Bravery of Diomed, and the words are as follows:-</p>
<p id="passage-121"><a href="#passage-121" class="passage-id">121</a> > There were the robes, many-coloured, the work of Sidonian women:
> They from Sidon had come, what time god-shaped Alexander
> Over the broad sea brought, that way, the high-born Helen.</p>
<p id="passage-122"><a href="#passage-122" class="passage-id">122</a> > In the Odyssey also the same fact is alluded to, in these words:-</p>
<p id="passage-123"><a href="#passage-123" class="passage-id">123</a> > Such, so wisely prepared, were the drugs that her stores
>     afforded,
> Excellent; gift which once Polydamna, partner of Thonis,
> Gave her in Egypt, where many the simples that grow in the
>     meadows,
> Potent to cure in part, in part as potent to injure.</p>
<p id="passage-124"><a href="#passage-124" class="passage-id">124</a> > Menelaus too, in the same poem, thus addresses Telemachus:-</p>
<p id="passage-125"><a href="#passage-125" class="passage-id">125</a> > Much did I long to return, but the Gods still kept me in Egypt-
> Angry because I had failed to pay them their hecatombs duly.</p>
<p id="passage-126"><a href="#passage-126" class="passage-id">126</a> In these places Homer shows himself acquainted with the voyage
of Alexander to Egypt, for Syria borders on Egypt, and the
Phoenicians, to whom Sidon belongs, dwell in Syria.</p>
<p id="passage-127"><a href="#passage-127" class="passage-id">127</a> From these various passages, and from that about Sidon especially,
it is clear that Homer did not write the Cypria. For there it is
said that Alexander arrived at Ilium with Helen on the third day after
he left Sparta, the wind having been favourable, and the sea smooth;
whereas in the Iliad, the poet makes him wander before he brings her
home. Enough, however, for the present of Homer and the Cypria.</p>
<p id="passage-128"><a href="#passage-128" class="passage-id">128</a> I made inquiry of the priests whether the story which the Greeks
tell about Ilium is a fable, or no. In reply they related the
following particulars, of which they declared that Menelaus had
himself informed them. After the rape of Helen, a vast army of Greeks,
wishing to render help to Menelaus, set sail for the Teucrian
territory; on their arrival they disembarked, and formed their camp,
after which they sent ambassadors to Ilium, of whom Menelaus was
one. The embassy was received within the walls, and demanded the
restoration of Helen with the treasures which Alexander had carried
off, and likewise required satisfaction for the wrong done. The
Teucrians gave at once the answer in which they persisted ever
afterwards, backing their assertions sometimes even with oaths, to
wit, that neither Helen, nor the treasures claimed, were in their
possession,- both the one and the other had remained, they said, in
Egypt; and it was not just to come upon them for what Proteus, king of
Egypt, was detaining. The Greeks, imagining that the Teucrians were
merely laughing at them, laid siege to the town, and never rested
until they finally took it. As, however, no Helen was found, and
they were still told the same story, they at length believed in its
truth, and despatched Menelaus to the court of Proteus.</p>
<p id="passage-129"><a href="#passage-129" class="passage-id">129</a> So Menelaus travelled to Egypt, and on his arrival sailed up the
river as far as Memphis, and related all that had happened. He met
with the utmost hospitality, received Helen back unharmed, and
recovered all his treasures. After this friendly treatment Menelaus,
they said, behaved most unjustly towards the Egyptians; for as it
happened that at the time when he wanted to take his departure, he was
detained by the wind being contrary, and as he found this
obstruction continue, he had recourse to a most wicked expedient. He
seized, they said, two children of the people of the country, and
offered them up in sacrifice. When this became known, the
indignation of the people was stirred, and they went in pursuit of
Menelaus, who, however, escaped with his ships to Libya, after which
the Egyptians could not say whither he went. The rest they knew full
well, partly by the inquiries which they had made, and partly from the
circumstances having taken place in their own land, and therefore
not admitting of doubt.</p>
<p id="passage-130"><a href="#passage-130" class="passage-id">130</a> Such is the account given by the Egyptian priests, and I am myself
inclined to regard as true all that they say of Helen from the
following considerations:- If Helen had been at Troy, the
inhabitants would, I think, have given her up to the Greeks, whether
Alexander consented to it or no. For surely neither Priam, nor his
family, could have been so infatuated as to endanger their own
persons, their children, and their city, merely that Alexander might
possess Helen. At any rate, if they determined to refuse at first, yet
afterwards when so many of the Trojans fell on every encounter with
the Greeks, and Priam too in each battle lost a son, or sometimes two,
or three, or even more, if we may credit the epic poets, I do not
believe that even if Priam himself had been married to her he would
have declined to deliver her up, with the view of bringing the
series of calamities to a close. Nor was it as if Alexander had been
heir to the crown, in which case he might have had the chief
management of affairs, since Priam was already old. Hector, who was
his elder brother, and a far braver man, stood before him, and was the
heir to the kingdom on the death of their father Priam. And it could
not be Hector's interest to uphold his brother in his wrong, when it
brought such dire calamities upon himself and the other Trojans. But
the fact was that they had no Helen to deliver, and so they told the
Greeks, but the Greeks would not believe what they said- Divine
Providence, as I think, so willing, that by their utter destruction it
might be made evident to all men that when great wrongs are done,
the gods will surely visit them with great punishments. Such, at
least, is my view of the matter.</p>
<p id="passage-131"><a href="#passage-131" class="passage-id">131</a> (1.) When Proteus died, Rhampsinitus, the priests informed me,
succeeded to the throne. His monuments were the western gateway of the
temple of Vulcan, and the two statues which stand in front of this
gateway, called by the Egyptians, the one Summer, the other Winter,
each twenty-five cubits in height. The statue of Summer, which is
the northernmost of the two, is worshipped by the natives, and has
offerings made to it; that of Winter, which stands towards the
south, is treated in exactly the contrary way. King Rhampsinitus was
possessed, they said, of great riches in silver- indeed to such an
amount, that none of the princes, his successors, surpassed or even
equalled his wealth. For the better custody of this money, he proposed
to build a vast chamber of hewn stone, one side of which was to form a
part of the outer wall of his palace. The builder, therefore, having
designs upon the treasures, contrived, as he was making the
building, to insert in this wall a stone, which could easily be
removed from its place by two men, or even by one. So the chamber
was finished, and the king's money stored away in it. Time passed, and
the builder fell sick, when finding his end approaching, he called for
his two sons, and related to them the contrivance he had made in the
king's treasure-chamber, telling them it was for their sakes he had
done it, that so they might always live in affluence. Then he gave
them clear directions concerning the mode of removing the stone, and
communicated the measurements, bidding them carefully keep the secret,
whereby they would be Comptrollers of the Royal Exchequer so long as
they lived. Then the father died, and the sons were not slow in
setting to work: they went by night to the palace, found the stone
in the wall of the building, and having removed it with ease,
plundered the treasury of a round sum.</p>
<p id="passage-132"><a href="#passage-132" class="passage-id">132</a> (2.) When the king next paid a visit to the apartment, he was
astonished to see that the money was sunk in some of the vessels
wherein it was stored away. Whom to accuse, however, he knew not, as
the seals were all perfect, and the fastenings of the room secure.
Still each time that he repeated his visits, he found that more
money was gone. The thieves in truth never stopped, but plundered
the treasury ever more and more. At last the king determined to have
some traps made, and set near the vessels which contained his
wealth. This was done, and when the thieves came, as usual, to the
treasure-chamber, and one of them entering through the aperture,
made straight for the jars, suddenly he found himself caught in one of
the traps. Perceiving that he was lost, he instantly called his
brother and telling him what had happened, entreated him to enter as
quickly as possible and cut off his head, that when his body should be
discovered it might not be recognised, which would have the effect
of bringing ruin upon both. The other thief thought the advice good,
and was persuaded to follow it then, fitting the stone into its place,
he went home, taking with him his brother's head.</p>
<p id="passage-133"><a href="#passage-133" class="passage-id">133</a> (3.) When day dawned, the king came into the room, and marvelled
greatly to see the body of the thief in the trap without a head, while
the building was still whole, and neither entrance nor exit was to
be seen anywhere. In this perplexity he commanded the body of the dead
man to be hung up outside the palace wall, and set a guard to watch
it, with orders that if any persons were seen weeping or lamenting
near the place, they should be seized and brought before him. When the
mother heard of this exposure of the corpse of her son, she took it
sorely to heart, and spoke to her surviving child, bidding him
devise some plan or other to get back the body, and threatening,
that if he did not exert himself, she would go herself to the king,
and denounce him as the robber.</p>
<p id="passage-134"><a href="#passage-134" class="passage-id">134</a> (4.) The son said all he could to persuade her to let the matter
rest, but in vain; she still continued to trouble him, until at last
he yielded to her importunity, and contrived as follows:- Filling some
skins with wine, he loaded them on donkeys, which he drove before
him till he came to the place where the guards were watching the
dead body, when pulling two or three of the skins towards him, he
untied some of the necks which dangled by the asses' sides. The wine
poured freely out, whereupon he began to beat his head, and shout with
all his might, seeming not to know which of the donkeys he should turn
to first. When the guards saw the wine running, delighted to profit by
the occasion, they rushed one and all into the road, each with some
vessel or other, and caught the liquor as it was spilling. The
driver pretended anger, and loaded them with abuse; whereon they did
their best to pacify him, until at last he appeared to soften, and
recover his good humour, drove his asses aside out of the road, and
set to work to rearrange their burthens; meanwhile, as he talked and
chatted with the guards, one of them began to rally him, and make
him laugh, whereupon he gave them one of the skins as a gift. They now
made up their minds to sit down and have a drinking-bout where they
were, so they begged him to remain and drink with them. Then the man
let himself be persuaded, and stayed. As the drinking went on, they
grew very friendly together, so presently he gave them another skin,
upon which they drank so copiously that they were all overcome with
the liquor, and growing drowsy lay down, and fell asleep on the
spot. The thief waited till it was the dead of the night, and then
took down the body of his brother; after which, in mockery, he
shaved off the right side of all the soldiers' beards, and so left
them. Laying his brother's body upon the asses, he carried it home
to his mother, having thus accomplished the thing that she had
required of him.</p>
<p id="passage-135"><a href="#passage-135" class="passage-id">135</a> (5.) When it came to the king's ears that the thief's body was
stolen away, he was sorely vexed. Wishing, therefore, whatever it
might cost, to catch the man who had contrived the trick, he had
recourse (the priests said) to an expedient, which I can scarcely
credit. He sent his own daughter to the common stews, with orders to
admit all comers, but to require every man to tell her what was the
cleverest and wickedest thing he had done in the whole course of his
life. If any one in reply told her the story of the thief, she was
to lay hold of him and not allow him to get away. The daughter did
as her father willed, whereon the thief, who was well aware of the
king's motive, felt a desire to outdo him in craft and cunning.
Accordingly he contrived the following plan:- He procured the corpse
of a man lately dead, and cutting of one of the arms at the
shoulder, put it under his dress, and so went to the king's
daughter. When she put the question to him as she had done to all
the rest, he replied that the wickedest thing he had ever done was
cutting off the head of his brother when he was caught in a trap in
the king's treasury, and the cleverest was making the guards drunk and
carrying off the body. As he spoke, the princess caught at him, but
the thief took advantage of the darkness to hold out to her the hand
of the corpse. Imagining it to be his own hand, she seized and held it
fast; while the thief, leaving it in her grasp, made his escape by the
door.</p>
<p id="passage-136"><a href="#passage-136" class="passage-id">136</a> (6.) The king, when word was brought him of this fresh success,
amazed at the sagacity and boldness of the man, sent messengers to all
the towns in his dominions to proclaim a free pardon for the thief,
and to promise him a rich reward, if he came and made himself known.
The thief took the king at his word, and came boldly into his
presence; whereupon Rhampsinitus, greatly admiring him, and looking on
him as the most knowing of men, gave him his daughter in marriage.
"The Egyptians," he said, "excelled all the rest of the world in
wisdom, and this man excelled all other Egyptians."</p>
<p id="passage-137"><a href="#passage-137" class="passage-id">137</a> The same king, I was also informed by the priests, afterwards
descended alive into the region which the Greeks call Hades, and there
played at dice with Ceres, sometimes winning and sometimes suffering
defeat. After a while he returned to earth, and brought with him a
golden napkin, a gift which he had received from the goddess. From
this descent of Rhampsinitus into Hades, and return to earth again,
the Egyptians, I was told, instituted a festival, which they certainly
celebrated in my day. On what occasion it was that they instituted it,
whether upon this or upon any other, I cannot determine. The following
are the ceremonies:- On a certain day in the year the priests weave
a mande, and binding the eyes of one of their number with a fillet,
they put the mantle upon him, and take him with them into the
roadway conducting to the temple of Ceres, when they depart and
leave him to himself. Then the priest, thus blindfolded, is led
(they say) by two wolves to the temple of Ceres, distant twenty
furlongs from the city, where he stays awhile, after which he is
brought back from the temple by the wolves, and left upon the spot
where they first joined him.</p>
<p id="passage-138"><a href="#passage-138" class="passage-id">138</a> Such as think the tales told by the Egyptians credible are free to
accept them for history. For my own part, I propose to myself
throughout my whole work faithfully to record the traditions of the
several nations. The Egyptians maintain that Ceres and Bacchus preside
in the realms below. They were also the first to broach the opinion
that the soul of man is immortal and that, when the body dies, it
enters into the form of an animal which is born at the moment,
thence passing on from one animal into another, until it has circled
through the forms of all the creatures which tenant the earth, the
water, and the air, after which it enters again into a human frame,
and is born anew. The whole period of the transmigration is (they say)
three thousand years. There are Greek writers, some of an earlier,
some of a later date, who have borrowed this doctrine from the
Egyptians, and put it forward as their own. I could mention their
names, but I abstain from doing so.</p>
<p id="passage-139"><a href="#passage-139" class="passage-id">139</a> Till the death of Rhampsinitus, the priests said, Egypt was
excellently governed, and flourished greatly; but after him Cheops
succeeded to the throne, and plunged into all manner of wickedness. He
closed the temples, and forbade the Egyptians to offer sacrifice,
compelling them instead to labour, one and all, in his service. Some
were required to drag blocks of stone down to the Nile from the
quarries in the Arabian range of hills; others received the blocks
after they had been conveyed in boats across the river, and drew
them to the range of hills called the Libyan. A hundred thousand men
laboured constantly, and were relieved every three months by a fresh
lot. It took ten years' oppression of the people to make the
causeway for the conveyance of the stones, a work not much inferior,
in my judgment, to the pyramid itself. This causeway is five
furlongs in length, ten fathoms wide, and in height, at the highest
part, eight fathoms. It is built of polished stone, and is covered
with carvings of animals. To make it took ten years, as I said- or
rather to make the causeway, the works on the mound where the
pyramid stands, and the underground chambers, which Cheops intended as
vaults for his own use: these last were built on a sort of island,
surrounded by water introduced from the Nile by a canal. The pyramid
itself was twenty years in building. It is a square, eight hundred
feet each way, and the height the same, built entirely of polished
stone, fitted together with the utmost care. The stones of which it is
composed are none of them less than thirty feet in length.</p>
<p id="passage-140"><a href="#passage-140" class="passage-id">140</a> The pyramid was built in steps, battlement-wise, as it is
called, or, according to others, altar-wise. After laying the stones
for the base, they raised the remaining stones to their places by
means of machines formed of short wooden planks. The first machine
raised them from the ground to the top of the first step. On this
there was another machine, which received the stone upon its
arrival, and conveyed it to the second step, whence a third machine
advanced it still higher. Either they had as many machines as there
were steps in the pyramid, or possibly they had but a single
machine, which, being easily moved, was transferred from tier to
tier as the stone rose- both accounts are given, and therefore I
mention both. The upper portion of the pyramid was finished first,
then the middle, and finally the part which was lowest and nearest the
ground. There is an inscription in Egyptian characters on the
pyramid which records the quantity of radishes, onions, and garlic
consumed by the labourers who constructed it; and I perfectly well
remember that the interpreter who read the writing to me said that the
money expended in this way was 1600 talents of silver. If this then is
a true record, what a vast sum must have been spent on the iron
tools used in the work, and on the feeding and clothing of the
labourers, considering the length of time the work lasted, which has
already been stated, and the additional time- no small space, I
imagine- which must have been occupied by the quarrying of the stones,
their conveyance, and the formation of the underground apartments.</p>
<p id="passage-141"><a href="#passage-141" class="passage-id">141</a> The wickedness of Cheops reached to such a pitch that, when he had
spent all his treasures and wanted more, he sent his daughter to the
stews, with orders to procure him a certain sum- how much I cannot
say, for I was not told; she procured it, however, and at the same
time, bent on leaving a monument which should perpetuate her own
memory, she required each man to make her a present of a stone towards
the works which she contemplated. With these stones she built the
pyramid which stands midmost of the three that are in front of the
great pyramid, measuring along each side a hundred and fifty feet.</p>
<p id="passage-142"><a href="#passage-142" class="passage-id">142</a> Cheops reigned, the Egyptians said, fifty years, and was succeeded
at his demise by Chephren, his brother.</p>
<p id="passage-143"><a href="#passage-143" class="passage-id">143</a> Chephren imitated the conduct of his predecessor, and, like him,
built a pyramid, which did not, however, equal the dimensions of his
brother's. Of this I am certain, for I measured them both myself. It
has no subterraneous apartments, nor any canal from the Nile to supply
it with water, as the other pyramid has. In that, the Nile water,
introduced through an artificial duct, surrounds an island, where
the body of Cheops is said to lie. Chephren built his pyramid close to
the great pyramid of Cheops, and of the same dimensions, except that
he lowered the height forty feet. For the basement he employed the
many-coloured stone of Ethiopia. These two pyramids stand both on
the same hill, an elevation not far short of a hundred feet in height.
The reign of Chephren lasted fifty-six years.</p>
<p id="passage-144"><a href="#passage-144" class="passage-id">144</a> Thus the affliction of Egypt endured for the space of one
hundred and six years, during the whole of which time the temples were
shut up and never opened. The Egyptians so detest the memory of
these kings that they do not much like even to mention their names.
Hence they commonly call the pyramids after Philition, a shepherd
who at that time fed his flocks about the place.</p>
<p id="passage-145"><a href="#passage-145" class="passage-id">145</a> After Chephren, Mycerinus (they said), son of Cheops, ascended the
throne. This prince disapproved the conduct of his father, re-opened
the temples, and allowed the people, who were ground down to the
lowest point of misery, to return to their occupations, and to
resume the practice of sacrifice. His justice in the decision of
causes was beyond that of all the former kings. The Egyptians praise
him in this respect more highly than any of their other monarchs,
declaring that he not only gave his judgments with fairness, but also,
when any one was dissatisfied with his sentence, made compensation
to him out of his own purse, and thus pacified his anger. Mycerinus
had established his character for mildness, and was acting as I have
described, when the stroke of calamity fell on him. First of all his
daughter died, the only child that he possessed. Experiencing a bitter
grief at this visitation, in his sorrow he conceived the wish to
entomb his child in some unusual way. He therefore caused a cow to
be made of wood, and after the interior had been hollowed out, he
had the whole surface coated with gold; and in this novel tomb laid
the dead body of his daughter.</p>
<p id="passage-146"><a href="#passage-146" class="passage-id">146</a> The cow was not placed under ground, but continued visible to my
times: it was at Sais, in the royal palace, where it occupied a
chamber richly adorned. Every day there are burnt before it
aromatics of every kind; and all night long a lamp is kept burning
in the apartment. In an adjoining chamber are statues which the
priests at Sais, declared to represent the various concubines of
Mycerinus. They are colossal figures in wood, of the number of about
twenty, and are represented naked. Whose images they really are, I
cannot say- I can only repeat the account which was given to me.</p>
<p id="passage-147"><a href="#passage-147" class="passage-id">147</a> Concerning these colossal figures and the sacred cow, there is
also another tale narrated, which runs thus: "Mycerinus was
enamoured of his daughter, and offered her violence- the damsel for
grief hanged herself, and Mycerinus entombed her in the cow. Then
her mother cut off the hands of all her tiring- maids, because they
had sided with the father, and betrayed the child; and so the
statues of the maids have no hands." All this is mere fable in my
judgment, especially what is said about the hands of the colossal
statues. I could plainly see that the figures had only lost their
hands through the effect of time. They had dropped off, and were still
lying on the ground about the feet of the statues.</p>
<p id="passage-148"><a href="#passage-148" class="passage-id">148</a> As for the cow, the greater portion of it is hidden by a scarlet
coverture; the head and neck, however, which are visible, are coated
very thickly with gold, and between the horns there is a
representation in gold of the orb of the sun. The figure is not erect,
but lying down, with the limbs under the body; the dimensions being
fully those of a large animal of the kind. Every year it is taken from
the apartment where it is kept, and exposed to the light of day-
this is done at the season when the Egyptians beat themselves in
honour of one of their gods, whose name I am unwilling to mention in
connection with such a matter. They say that the daughter of Mycerinus
requested her father in her dying moments to allow her once a year
to see the sun.</p>
<p id="passage-149"><a href="#passage-149" class="passage-id">149</a> After the death of his daughter, Mycerinus was visited with a
second calamity, of which I shall now proceed to give an account. An
oracle reached him from the town of Buto, which said, "Six years
only shalt thou live upon the earth, and in the seventh thou shalt end
thy days." Mycerinus, indignant, sent an angry message to the
oracle, reproaching the god with his injustice- "My father and uncle,"
he said, "though they shut up the temples, took no thought of the
gods, and destroyed multitudes of men, nevertheless enjoyed a long
life; I, who am pious, am to die so soon!" There came in reply a
second message from the oracle- "For this very reason is thy life
brought so quickly to a close- thou hast not done as it behoved
thee. Egypt was fated to suffer affliction one hundred and fifty
years- the two kings who preceded thee upon the throne understood
this- thou hast not understood it." Mycerinus, when this answer
reached him, perceiving that his doom was fixed, had prepared, which
he lighted every day at eventime, and feasted and enjoyed himself
unceasingly both day and night, moving about in the marsh-country
and the woods, and visiting all the places that he heard were
agreeable sojourns. His wish was to prove the oracle false, by turning
the nights into days, and so living twelve years in the space of six.</p>
<p id="passage-150"><a href="#passage-150" class="passage-id">150</a> He too left a pyramid, but much inferior in size to his
father's. It is a square, each side of which falls short of three
plethra by twenty feet, and is built for half its height of the
stone of Ethiopia. Some of the Greeks call it the work of Rhodopis the
courtesan, but they report falsely. It seems to me that these
persons cannot have any real knowledge who Rhodopis was; otherwise
they would scarcely have ascribed to her a work on which uncounted
treasures, so to speak, must have been expended. Rhodopis also lived
during the reign of Amasis, not of Mycerinus, and was thus very many
years later than the time of the kings who built the pyramids. She was
a Thracian by birth, and was the slave of Iadmon, son of
Hephaestopolis, a Samian. Aesop, the fable-writer, was one of her
fellow-slaves. That Aesop belonged to Iadmon is proved by many
facts- among others, by this. When the Delphians, in obedience to
the command of the oracle, made proclamation that if any one claimed
compensation for the murder of Aesop he should receive it, the
person who at last came forward was Iadmon, grandson of the former
Iadmon, and he received the compensation. Aesop therefore must
certainly have been the former Iadmon's slave.</p>
<p id="passage-151"><a href="#passage-151" class="passage-id">151</a> Rhodopis really arrived in Egypt under the conduct of Xantheus the
Samian; she was brought there to exercise her trade, but was
redeemed for a vast sum by Charaxus, a Mytilenaean, the son of
Scamandronymus, and brother of Sappho the poetess. After thus
obtaining her freedom, she remained in Egypt, and, as she was very
beautiful, amassed great wealth, for a person in her condition; not,
however, enough to enable her to erect such a work as this pyramid.
Any one who likes may go and see to what the tenth part of her
wealth amounted, and he will thereby learn that her riches must not be
imagined to have been very wonderfully great. Wishing to leave a
memorial of herself in Greece, she determined to have something made
the like of which was not to be found in any temple, and to offer it
at the shrine at Delphi. So she set apart a tenth of her
possessions, and purchased with the money a quantity of iron spits,
such as are fit for roasting oxen whole, whereof she made a present to
the oracle. They are still to be seen there, lying of a heap, behind
the altar which the Chians dedicated, opposite the sanctuary.
Naucratis seems somehow to be the place where such women are most
attractive. First there was this Rhodopis of whom we have been
speaking, so celebrated a person that her name came to be familiar
to all the Greeks; and, afterwards, there was another, called
Archidice, notorious throughout Greece, though not so much talked of
as her predecessor. Charaxus, after ransoming Rhodopis, returned to
Mytilene, and was often lashed by Sappho in her poetry. But enough has
been said on the subject of this courtesan.</p>
<p id="passage-152"><a href="#passage-152" class="passage-id">152</a> After Mycerinus, the priests said, Asychis ascended the throne. He
built the eastern gateway of the temple of Vulcan, which in size and
beauty far surpasses the other three. All the four gateways have
figures graven on them, and a vast amount of architectural ornament,
but the gateway of Asychis is by far the most richly adorned. In the
reign of this king, money being scarce and commercial dealings
straitened, a law was passed that the borrower might pledge his
father's body to raise the sum whereof he had need. A proviso was
appended to this law, giving the lender authority over the entire
sepulchre of the borrower, so that a man who took up money under
this pledge, if he died without paying the debt, could not obtain
burial either in his own ancestral tomb, or in any other, nor could he
during his lifetime bury in his own tomb any member of his family. The
same king, desirous of eclipsing all his predecessors upon the throne,
left as a monument of his reign a pyramid of brick. It bears an
inscription, cut in stone, which runs thus:- "Despise me not in
comparison with the stone pyramids; for I surpass them all, as much as
Jove surpasses the other gods. A pole was plunged into a lake, and the
mud which clave thereto was gathered; and bricks were made of the mud,
and so I was formed." Such were the chief actions of this prince.</p>
<p id="passage-153"><a href="#passage-153" class="passage-id">153</a> He was succeeded on the throne, they said, by a blind man, a
native of Anysis, whose own name also was Anysis. Under him Egypt
was invaded by a vast army of Ethiopians, led by Sabacos, their
king. The blind Anysis fled away to the marsh-country, and the
Ethiopian was lord of the land for fifty years, during which his
mode of rule was the following:- When an Egyptian was guilty of an
offence, his plan was not to punish him with death: instead of so
doing, he sentenced him, according to the nature of his crime, to
raise the ground to a greater or a less extent in the neighbourhood of
the city to which he belonged. Thus the cities came to be even more
elevated than they were before. As early as the time of Sesostris,
they had been raised by those who dug the canals in his reign; this
second elevation of the soil under the Ethiopian king gave them a very
lofty position. Among the many cities which thus attained to a great
elevation, none (I think) was raised so much as the town called
Bubastis, where there is a temple of the goddess Bubastis, which
well deserves to be described. Other temples may be grander, and may
have cost more in the building, but there is none so pleasant to the
eye as this of Bubastis. The Bubastis of the Egyptians is the same
as the Artemis (Diana) of the Greeks.</p>
<p id="passage-154"><a href="#passage-154" class="passage-id">154</a> The following is a description of this edifice:- Excepting the
entrance, the whole forms an island. Two artificial channels from
the Nile, one on either side of the temple, encompass the building,
leaving only a narrow passage by which it is approached. These
channels are each a hundred feet wide, and are thickly shaded with
trees. The gateway is sixty feet in height, and is ornamented with
figures cut upon the stone, six cubits high and well worthy of notice.
The temple stands in the middle of the city, and is visible on all
sides as one walks round it; for as the city has been raised up by
embankment, while the temple has been left untouched in its original
condition, you look down upon it wheresoever you are. A low wall
runs round the enclosure, having figures engraved upon it, and
inside there is a grove of beautiful tall trees growing round the
shrine, which contains the image of the goddess. The enclosure is a
furlong in length, and the same in breadth. The entrance to it is by a
road paved with stone for a distance of about three furlongs, which
passes straight through the market-place with an easterly direction,
and is about four hundred feet in width. Trees of an extraordinary
height grow on each side the road, which conducts from the temple of
Bubastis to that of Mercury.</p>
<p id="passage-155"><a href="#passage-155" class="passage-id">155</a> The Ethiopian finally quitted Egypt, the priests said, by a
hasty flight under the following circumstances. He saw in his sleep
a vision:- a man stood by his side, and counselled him to gather
together all the priests of Egypt and cut every one of them asunder.
On this, according to the account which he himself gave, it came
into his mind that the gods intended hereby to lead him to commit an
act of sacrilege, which would be sure to draw down upon him some
punishment either at the hands of gods or men. So he resolved not to
do the deed suggested to him, but rather to retire from Egypt, as
the time during which it was fated that he should hold the country had
now (he thought) expired. For before he left Ethiopia he had been told
by the oracles which are venerated there, that he was to reign fifty
years over Egypt. The years were now fled, and the dream had come to
trouble him; he therefore of his own accord withdrew from the land.</p>
<p id="passage-156"><a href="#passage-156" class="passage-id">156</a> As soon as Sabacos was gone, the blind king left the marshes,
and resumed the government. He had lived in the marsh-region the whole
time, having formed for himself an island there by a mixture of
earth and ashes. While he remained, the natives had orders to bring
him food unbeknown to the Ethiopian, and latterly, at his request,
each man had brought him, with the food, a certain quantity of
ashes. Before Amyrtaeus, no one was able to discover the site of
this island, which continued unknown to the kings of Egypt who
preceded him on the throne for the space of seven hundred years and
more. The name which it bears is Elbo. It is about ten furlongs across
in each direction.</p>
<p id="passage-157"><a href="#passage-157" class="passage-id">157</a> The next king, I was told, was a priest of Vulcan, called
Sethos. This monarch despised and neglected the warrior class of the
Egyptians, as though he did not need their services. Among other
indignities which he offered them, he took from them the lands which
they had possessed under all the previous kings, consisting of
twelve acres of choice land for each warrior. Afterwards, therefore,
when Sanacharib, king of the Arabians and Assyrians, marched his
vast army into Egypt, the warriors one and all refused to come to
his aid. On this the monarch, greatly distressed, entered into the
inner sanctuary, and, before the image of the god, bewailed the fate
which impended over him. As he wept he fell asleep, and dreamed that
the god came and stood at his side, bidding him be of good cheer,
and go boldly forth to meet the Arabian host, which would do him no
hurt, as he himself would send those who should help him. Sethos,
then, relying on the dream, collected such of the Egyptians as were
willing to follow him, who were none of them warriors, but traders,
artisans, and market people; and with these marched to Pelusium, which
commands the entrance into Egypt, and there pitched his camp. As the
two armies lay here opposite one another, there came in the night, a
multitude of field-mice, which devoured all the quivers and bowstrings
of the enemy, and ate the thongs by which they managed their
shields. Next morning they commenced their fight, and great multitudes
fell, as they had no arms with which to defend themselves. There
stands to this day in the temple of Vulcan, a stone statue of
Sethos, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription to this effect-
"Look on me, and learn to reverence the gods."</p>
<p id="passage-158"><a href="#passage-158" class="passage-id">158</a> Thus far I have spoken on the authority of the Egyptians and their
priests. They declare that from their first king to this
last-mentioned monarch, the priest of Vulcan, was a period of three
hundred and forty-one generations; such, at least, they say, was the
number both of their kings, and of their high-priests, during this
interval. Now three hundred generations of men make ten thousand
years, three generations filling up the century; and the remaining
forty-one generations make thirteen hundred and forty years. Thus
the whole number of years is eleven thousand, three hundred and forty;
in which entire space, they said, no god had ever appeared in a
human form; nothing of this kind had happened either under the
former or under the later Egyptian kings. The sun, however, had within
this period of time, on four several occasions, moved from his
wonted course, twice rising where he now sets, and twice setting where
he now rises. Egypt was in no degree affected by these changes; the
productions of the land, and of the river, remained the same; nor
was there anything unusual either in the diseases or the deaths.</p>
<p id="passage-159"><a href="#passage-159" class="passage-id">159</a> When Hecataeus the historian was at Thebes, and, discoursing of
his genealogy, traced his descent to a god in the person of his
sixteenth ancestor, the priests of Jupiter did to him exactly as
they afterwards did to me, though I made no boast of my family. They
led me into the inner sanctuary, which is a spacious chamber, and
showed me a multitude of colossal statues, in wood, which they counted
up, and found to amount to the exact number they had said; the
custom being for every high priest during his lifetime to set up his
statue in the temple. As they showed me the figures and reckoned
them up, they assured me that each was the son of the one preceding
him; and this they repeated throughout the whole line, beginning
with the representation of the priest last deceased, and continuing
till they had completed the series. When Hecataeus, in giving his
genealogy, mentioned a god as his sixteenth ancestor, the priests
opposed their genealogy to his, going through this list, and
refusing to allow that any man was ever born of a god. Their
colossal figures were each, they said, a Piromis, born of a Piromis,
and the number of them was three hundred and forty-five; through the
whole series Piromis followed Piromis, and the line did not run up
either to a god or a hero. The word Piromis may be rendered
"gentleman."</p>
<p id="passage-160"><a href="#passage-160" class="passage-id">160</a> Of such a nature were, they said, the beings represented by
these images- they were very far indeed from being gods. However, in
the times anterior to them it was otherwise; then Egypt had gods for
its rulers, who dwelt upon the earth with men, one being always
supreme above the rest. The last of these was Horus, the son of
Osiris, called by the Greeks Apollo. He deposed Typhon, and ruled over
Egypt as its last god-king. Osiris is named Dionysus (Bacchus) by
the Greeks.</p>
<p id="passage-161"><a href="#passage-161" class="passage-id">161</a> The Greeks regard Hercules, Bacchus, and Pan as the youngest of
the gods. With the Egyptians, contrariwise, Pan is exceedingly
ancient, and belongs to those whom they call "the eight gods," who
existed before the rest. Hercules is one of the gods of the second
order, who are known as "the twelve"; and Bacchus belongs to the
gods of the third order, whom the twelve produced. I have already
mentioned how many years intervened according to the Egyptians between
the birth of Hercules and the reign of Amasis. From Pan to this period
they count a still longer time; and even from Bacchus, who is the
youngest of the three, they reckon fifteen thousand years to the reign
of that king. In these matters they say they cannot be mistaken, as
they have always kept count of the years, and noted them in their
registers. But from the present day to the time of Bacchus, the
reputed son of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, is a period of not more
than sixteen hundred years; to that of Hercules, son of Alcmena, is
about nine hundred; while to the time of Pan, son of Penelope (Pan,
according to the Greeks, was her child by Mercury), is a shorter space
than to the Trojan war, eight hundred years or thereabouts.</p>
<p id="passage-162"><a href="#passage-162" class="passage-id">162</a> It is open to all to receive whichever he may prefer of these
two traditions; my own opinion about them has been already declared.
If indeed these gods had been publicly known, and had grown old in
Greece, as was the case with Hercules, son of Amphitryon, Bacchus, son
of Semele, and Pan, son of Penelope, it might have been said that
the last-mentioned personages were men who bore the names of certain
previously existing deities. But Bacchus, according to the Greek
tradition, was no sooner born than he was sewn up in Jupiter's
thigh, and carried off to Nysa, above Egypt, in Ethiopia; and as to
Pan, they do not even profess to know what happened to him after his
birth. To me, therefore, it is quite manifest that the names of
these gods became known to the Greeks after those of their other
deities, and that they count their birth from the time when they first
acquired a knowledge of them. Thus far my narrative rests on the
accounts given by the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="passage-163"><a href="#passage-163" class="passage-id">163</a> In what follows I have the authority, not of the Egyptians only,
but of others also who agree with them. I shall speak likewise in part
from my own observation. When the Egyptians regained their liberty
after the reign of the priest of Vulcan, unable to continue any
while without a king, they divided Egypt into twelve districts, and
set twelve kings over them. These twelve kings, united together by
intermarriages, ruled Egypt in peace, having entered into
engagements with one another not to depose any of their number, nor to
aim at any aggrandisement of one above the rest, but to dwell together
in perfect amity. Now the reason why they made these stipulations, and
guarded with care against their infraction, was because at the very
first establishment of the twelve kingdoms an oracle had declared-
"That he among them who should pour in Vulcan's temple a libation from
a cup of bronze would become monarch of the whole land of Egypt."
Now the twelve held their meetings at all the temples.</p>
<p id="passage-164"><a href="#passage-164" class="passage-id">164</a> To bind themselves yet more closely together, it seemed good to
them to leave a common monument. In pursuance of this resolution
they made the Labyrinth which lies a little above Lake Moeris, in
the neighbourhood of the place called the city of Crocodiles. I
visited this place, and found it to surpass description; for if all
the walls and other great works of the Greeks could be put together in
one, they would not equal, either for labour or expense, this
Labyrinth; and yet the temple of Ephesus is a building worthy of note,
and so is the temple of Samos. The pyramids likewise surpass
description, and are severally equal to a number of the greatest works
of the Greeks, but the Labyrinth surpasses the pyramids. It has twelve
courts, all of them roofed, with gates exactly opposite one another,
six looking to the north, and six to the south. A single wall
surrounds the entire building. There are two different sorts of
chambers throughout- half under ground, half above ground, the
latter built upon the former; the whole number of these chambers is
three thousand, fifteen hundred of each kind. The upper chambers I
myself passed through and saw, and what I say concerning them is
from my own observation; of the underground chambers I can only
speak from report: for the keepers of the building could not be got to
show them, since they contained (as they said) the sepulchres of the
kings who built the Labyrinth, and also those of the sacred
crocodiles. Thus it is from hearsay only that I can speak of the lower
chambers. The upper chambers, however, I saw with my own eyes, and
found them to excel all other human productions; for the passages
through the houses, and the varied windings of the paths across the
courts excited in me infinite admiration as I passed from the courts
into chambers, and from the chambers into colonnades, and from the
colonnades into fresh houses, and again from these into courts
unseen before. The roof was throughout of stone, like the walls; and
the walls were carved all over with figures; every court was
surrounded with a colonnade which was built of white stones
exquisitely fitted together. At the corner of the Labyrinth stands a
pyramid, forty fathoms high, with large figures engraved on it,
which is entered by a subterranean passage.</p>
<p id="passage-165"><a href="#passage-165" class="passage-id">165</a> Wonderful as is the Labyrinth, the work called the Lake of Moeris,
which is close by the Labyrinth, is yet more astonishing. The
measure of its circumference is sixty schoenes, or three thousand
six hundred furlongs, which is equal to the entire length of Egypt
along the sea-coast. The lake stretches in its longest direction
from north to south, and in its deepest parts is of the depth of fifty
fathoms. It is manifestly an artificial excavation, for nearly in
the centre there stand two pyramids, rising to the height of fifty
fathoms above the surface of the water, and extending as far
beneath, crowned each of them with a colossal statue sitting upon a
throne. Thus these pyramids are one hundred fathoms high, which is
exactly a furlong (stadium) of six hundred feet: the fathom being
six feet in length, or four cubits, which is the same thing, since a
cubit measures six, and a foot four, palms. The water of the lake does
not come out of the ground, which is here excessively dry, but is
introduced by a canal from the Nile. The current sets for six months
into the lake from the river, and for the next six months into the
river from the lake. it runs outward it returns a talent of silver
daily to the royal treasury from the fish that are taken, but when the
current is the other way the return sinks to one-third of that sum.</p>
<p id="passage-166"><a href="#passage-166" class="passage-id">166</a> The natives told me that there was a subterranean passage from
this lake to the Libyan Syrtis, running westward into the interior
by the hills above Memphis. As I could not anywhere see the earth
which had been taken out when the excavation was made, and I was
curious to know what had become of it, I asked the Egyptians who
live closest to the lake where the earth had been put. The answer that
they gave me I readily accepted as true, since I had heard of the same
thing being done at Nineveh of the Assyrians. There, once upon a time,
certain thieves, having formed a plan to get into their possession the
vast treasures of Sardanapalus, the Ninevite king, which were laid
up in subterranean treasuries, proceeded to tunnel a passage from
the house where they lived into the royal palace, calculating the
distance and the direction. At nightfall they took the earth from
the excavation and carried it to the river Tigris, which ran by
Nineveh, continuing to get rid of it in this manner until they had
accomplished their purpose. It was exactly in the same way that the
Egyptians disposed of the mould from their excavation, except that
they did it by day and not by night; for as fast as the earth was dug,
they carried it to the Nile, which they knew would disperse it far and
wide. Such was the account which I received of the formation of this
lake.</p>
<p id="passage-167"><a href="#passage-167" class="passage-id">167</a> The twelve kings for some time dealt honourably by one another,
but at length it happened that on a certain occasion, when they had
met to worship in the temple of Vulcan, the high-priest on the last
day of the festival, in bringing forth the golden goblets from which
they were wont to pour the libations, mistook the number and brought
eleven goblets only for the twelve princes. Psammetichus was
standing last, and, being left without a cup, he took his helmet,
which was of bronze, from off his head, stretched it out to receive
the liquor, and so made his libation. All the kings were accustomed to
wear helmets, and all indeed wore them at this very time. Nor was
there any crafty design in the action of Psammetichus. The eleven,
however, when they came to consider what had been done, and
bethought them of the oracle which had declared "that he who, of the
twelve, should pour a libation from a cup of bronze, the same would be
king of the whole land of Egypt," doubted at first if they should
not put Psammetichus to death. Finding, however, upon examination,
that he had acted in the matter without any guilty intent, they did
not think it would be just to kill him; but determined, instead, to
strip him of the chief part of his power and to banish him to the
marshes, forbidding him to leave them or to hold any communication
with the rest of Egypt.</p>
<p id="passage-168"><a href="#passage-168" class="passage-id">168</a> This was the second time that Psammetichus had been driven into
banishment. On a former occasion he had fled from Sabacos the
Ethiopian, who had put his father Necos to death; and had taken refuge
in Syria from whence, after the retirement of the Ethiop in
consequence of his dream, he was brought back by the Egyptians of
the Saitic canton. Now it was his ill-fortune to be banished a
second time by the eleven kings, on account of the libation which he
had poured from his helmet; on this occasion he fled to the marshes.
Feeling that he was an injured man, and designing to avenge himself
upon his persecutors, Psammetichus sent to the city of Buto, where
there is an oracle of Latona, the most veracious of all the oracles of
the Egyptians, and having inquired concerning means of vengeance,
received for answer that "Vengeance would come from the sea, when
brazen men should appear." Great was his incredulity when this
answer arrived, for never, he thought, would brazen men arrive to be
his helpers. However, not long afterwards certain Carians and
Ionians who had left their country on a voyage of plunder, were
carried by stress of weather to Egypt where they disembarked, all
equipped in their brazen armour, and were seen by the natives, one
of whom carried the tidings to Psammetichus, and, as he had never
before seen men clad in brass, he reported that brazen men had come
from the sea and were plundering the plain. Psammetichus, perceiving
at once that the oracle was accomplished, made friendly advances to
the strangers, and engaged them, by splendid promises, to enter into
his service. He then, with their aid and that of the Egyptians who
espoused his cause, attacked the eleven and vanquished them.</p>
<p id="passage-169"><a href="#passage-169" class="passage-id">169</a> When Psammetichus had thus become sole monarch of Egypt, he
built the southern gateway of the temple of Vulcan in Memphis, and
also a court for Apis, in which Apis is kept whenever he makes his
appearance in Egypt. This court is opposite the gateway of
Psammetichus, and is surrounded with a colonnade and adorned with a
multitude of figures. Instead of pillars, the colonnade rests upon
colossal statues, twelve cubits in height. The Greek name for Apis
is Epaphus.</p>
<p id="passage-170"><a href="#passage-170" class="passage-id">170</a> To the Ionians and Carians who had lent him their assistance
Psammetichus assigned as abodes two places opposite to each other, one
on either side of the Nile, which received the name of "the Camps." He
also made good all the splendid promises by which he had gained
their support; and further, he intrusted to their care certain
Egyptian children whom they were to teach the language of the
Greeks. These children, thus instructed, became the parents of the
entire class of interpreters in Egypt. The Ionians and Carians
occupied for many years the places assigned them by Psammetichus,
which lay near the sea, a little below the city of Bubastis, on the
Pelusiac mouth of the Nile. King Amasis long afterwards removed the
Greeks hence, and settled them at Memphis to guard him against the
native Egyptians. From the date of the original settlement of these
persons in Egypt, we Greeks, through our intercourse with them, have
acquired an accurate knowledge of the several events in Egyptian
history, from the reign of Psammetichus downwards; but before his time
no foreigners had ever taken up their residence in that land. The
docks where their vessels were laid up and the ruins of their
habitations were still to be seen in my day at the place where they
dwelt originally, before they were removed by Amasis. Such was the
mode by which Psammetichus became master of Egypt.</p>
<p id="passage-171"><a href="#passage-171" class="passage-id">171</a> I have already made mention more than once of the Egyptian oracle,
and, as it well deserves notice, I shall now proceed to give an
account of it more at length. It is a temple of Latona, situated in
the midst of a great city on the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile, at some
distance up the river from the sea. The name of the city, as I have
before observed, is Buto; and in it are two other temples also, one of
Apollo and one of Diana. Latona's temple, which contains the oracle,
is a spacious building with a gateway ten fathoms in height. The
most wonderful thing that was actually to be seen about this temple
was a chapel in the enclosure made of a single stone, the length and
height of which were the same, each wall being forty cubits square,
and the whole a single block! Another block of stone formed the roof
and projected at the eaves to the extent of four cubits.</p>
<p id="passage-172"><a href="#passage-172" class="passage-id">172</a> This, as I have said, was what astonished me the most, of all
the things that were actually to be seen about the temple. The next
greatest marvel was the island called Chemmis. This island lies in the
middle of a broad and deep lake close by the temple, and the natives
declare that it floats. For my own part I did not see it float, or
even move; and I wondered greatly, when they told me concerning it,
whether there be really such a thing as a floating island. It has a
grand temple of Apollo built upon it, in which are three distinct
altars. Palm trees grow on it in great abundance, and many other
trees, some of which bear fruit, while others are barren. The
Egyptians tell the following story in connection with this island,
to explain the way in which it first came to float:- "In former times,
when the isle was still fixed and motionless, Latona, one of the eight
gods of the first order, who dwelt in the city of Buto, where now
she has her oracle, received Apollo as a sacred charge from Isis,
and saved him by hiding him in what is now called the floating island.
Typhon meanwhile was searching everywhere in hopes of finding the
child of Osiris." (According to the Egyptians, Apollo and Diana are
the children of Bacchus and Isis, while Latona is their nurse and
their preserver. They call Apollo, in their language, Horus; Ceres
they call Isis; Diana, Bubastis. From this Egyptian tradition, and
from no other, it must have been that Aeschylus, the son of Euphorion,
took the idea, which is found in none of the earlier poets, of
making Diana the daughter of Ceres.) The island, therefore, in
consequence of this event, was first made to float. Such at least is
the account which the Egyptians give.</p>
<p id="passage-173"><a href="#passage-173" class="passage-id">173</a> Psammetichus ruled Egypt for fifty-four years, during
twenty-nine of which he pressed the siege of Azotus without
intermission, till finally he took the place. Azotus is a great town
in Syria. Of all the cities that we know, none ever stood so long a
siege.</p>
<p id="passage-174"><a href="#passage-174" class="passage-id">174</a> Psammetichus left a son called Necos, who succeeded him upon the
throne. This prince was the first to attempt the construction of the
canal to the Red Sea- a work completed afterwards by Darius the
Persian- the length of which is four days' journey, and the width such
as to admit of two triremes being rowed along it abreast. The water is
derived from the Nile, which the canal leaves a little above the
city of Bubastis, near Patumus, the Arabian town, being continued
thence until it joins the Red Sea. At first it is carried along the
Arabian side of the Egyptian plain, as far as the chain of hills
opposite Memphis, whereby the plain is bounded, and in which lie the
great stone quarries; here it skirts the base of the hills running
in a direction from west to east, after which it turns and enters a
narrow pass, trending southwards from this point until it enters the
Arabian Gulf. From the northern sea to that which is called the
southern or Erythraean, the shortest and quickest passage, which is
from Mount Casius, the boundary between Egypt and Syria, to the Gulf
of Arabia, is a distance of exactly one thousand furlongs. But the way
by the canal is very much longer on account of the crookedness of
its course. A hundred and twenty thousand of the Egyptians, employed
upon the work in the reign of Necos, lost their lives in making the
excavation. He at length desisted from his undertaking, in consequence
of an oracle which warned him "that he was labouring for the
barbarian." The Egyptians call by the name of barbarians all such as
speak a language different from their own.</p>
<p id="passage-175"><a href="#passage-175" class="passage-id">175</a> Necos, when he gave up the construction of the canal, turned all
his thoughts to war, and set to work to build a fleet of triremes,
some intended for service in the northern sea, and some for the
navigation of the Erythraean. These last were built in the Arabian
Gulf where the dry docks in which they lay are still visible. These
fleets he employed wherever he had occasion, while he also made war by
land upon the Syrians and defeated them in a pitched battle at
Magdolus, after which he made himself master of Cadytis, a large
city of Syria. The dress which he wore on these occasions he sent to
Branchidae in Milesia, as an offering to Apollo. After having
reigned in all sixteen years, Necos died, and at his death
bequeathed the throne to his son Psammis.</p>
<p id="passage-176"><a href="#passage-176" class="passage-id">176</a> In the reign of Psammis, ambassadors from Elis arrived in Egypt,
boasting that their arrangements for the conduct of the Olympic
Games were the best and fairest that could be devised, and fancying
that not even the Egyptians, who surpassed all other nations in
wisdom, could add anything to their perfection. When these persons
reached Egypt, and explained the reason of their visit, the king
summoned an assembly of all the wisest of the Egyptians. They met, and
the Eleans having given them a full account of all their rules and
regulations with respect to the contests said that they had come to
Egypt for the express purpose of learning whether the Egyptians
could improve the fairness of their regulations in any particular. The
Egyptians considered awhile and then made inquiry, "If they allowed
their own citizens to enter the lists?" The Eleans answered, "That the
lists were open to all Greeks, whether they belonged to Elis or to any
other state." Hereupon the Egyptians observed, "That if this were
so, they departed from justice very widely, since it was impossible
but that they would favour their own countrymen and deal unfairly by
foreigners. If therefore they really wished to manage the games with
fairness, and if this was the object of their coming to Egypt, they
advised them to confine the contests to strangers, and allow no native
of Elis to be a candidate." Such was the advice which the Egyptians
gave to the Eleans.</p>
<p id="passage-177"><a href="#passage-177" class="passage-id">177</a> Psammis reigned only six years. He attacked Ethiopia, and died
almost directly afterwards. Apries, his son, succeeded him upon the
throne, who, excepting Psammetichus, his great-grandfather, was the
most prosperous of all the kings that ever ruled over Egypt. The
length of his reign was twenty-five years, and in the course of it
he marched an army to attack Sidon, and fought a battle with the
king of Tyre by sea. When at length the time came that was fated to
bring him woe, an occasion arose which I shall describe more fully
in my Libyan history, only touching it very briefly here. An army
despatched by Apries to attack Cyrene, having met with a terrible
reverse, the Egyptians laid the blame on him, imagining that he had,
of malice prepense, sent the troops into the jaws of destruction. They
believed he had wished a vast number of them to be slain in order that
he himself might reign with more security over the rest of the
Egyptians. Indignant therefore at this usage, the soldiers who
returned and the friends of the slain broke instantly into revolt.</p>
<p id="passage-178"><a href="#passage-178" class="passage-id">178</a> Apries, on learning these circumstances, sent Amasis to the rebels
to appease the tumult by persuasion. Upon his arrival, as he was seek.
ing to restrain the malcontents by his exhortations, one of them,
coming behind him, put a helmet on his head, saying, as he put it
on, that he thereby crowned him king. Amasis was not altogether
displeased at the action, as his conduct soon made manifest; for no
sooner had the insurgents agreed to make him actually their king
than he prepared to march with them against Apries. That monarch, on
tidings of these events reaching him, sent Patarbemis, one of his
courtiers, a man of high rank, to Amasis with orders to bring him
alive into his presence. Patarbemis, on arriving at the place where
Amasis was, called on him to come back with him to the king, whereupon
Amasis broke a coarse jest, and said, "Prythee take that back to thy
master." When the envoy, notwithstanding this reply, persisted in
his request, exhorting Amasis to obey the summons of the king, he made
answer "that this was exactly what he had long been intending to do;
Apries would have no reason to complain of him on the score of
delay; he would shortly come himself to the king, and bring others
with him." Patarbemis, upon this, comprehending the intention of
Amasis, partly from his replies and partly from the preparations which
he saw in progress, departed hastily, wishing to inform the king
with all speed of what was going on. Apries, however, when he saw
him approaching without Amasis, fell into a paroxysm of rage, and
not giving himself time for reflection, commanded the nose and ears of
Patarbemis to be cut off. Then the rest of the Egyptians, who had
hitherto espoused the cause of Apries, when they saw a man of such
note among them so shamefully outraged, without a moment's
hesitation went over to the rebels, and put themselves at the disposal
of Amasis.</p>
<p id="passage-179"><a href="#passage-179" class="passage-id">179</a> Apries, informed of this new calamity, armed his mercenaries,
and led them against the Egyptians: this was a body of Carians and
Ionians, numbering thirty thousand men, which was now with him at
Says, where his palace stood- a vast building, well worthy of
notice. The army of Apries marched out to attack the host of the
Egyptians, while that of Amasis went forth to fight the strangers; and
now both armies drew near the city of Momemphis and prepared for the
coming fight.</p>
<p id="passage-180"><a href="#passage-180" class="passage-id">180</a> The Egyptians are divided into seven distinct classes- these
are, the priests, the warriors, the cowherds, the swineherds, the
tradesmen, the interpreters, and the boatmen. Their titles indicate
their occupations. The warriors consist of Hermotybians and
Calascirians, who come from different cantons, the whole of Egypt
being parcelled out into districts bearing this name.</p>
<p id="passage-181"><a href="#passage-181" class="passage-id">181</a> The following cantons furnish the Hermotybians:- The cantons of
Busiris, Sais, Chemmis, Papremis, that of the island called
Prosopitis, and half of Natho. They number, when most numerous, a
hundred and sixty thousand. None of them ever practices a trade, but
all are given wholly to war.</p>
<p id="passage-182"><a href="#passage-182" class="passage-id">182</a> The cantons of the Calascirians are different- they include the
following:- The cantons of Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes,
Sebennytus, Athribis, Pharbaethus, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anysis, and
Myecphoris- this last canton consists of an island which lies over
against the town of Bubastis. The Calascirians, when at their greatest
number, have amounted to two hundred and fifty thousand. Like the
Hermotybians, they are forbidden to pursue any trade, and devote
themselves entirely to warlike exercises, the son following the
father's calling.</p>
<p id="passage-183"><a href="#passage-183" class="passage-id">183</a> Whether the Greeks borrowed from the Egyptians their notions about
trade, like so many others, I cannot say for certain. I have
remarked that the Thracians, the Scyths, the Persians, the Lydians,
and almost all other barbarians, hold the citizens who practice
trades, and their children, in less repute than the rest, while they
esteem as noble those who keep aloof from handicrafts, and
especially honour such as are given wholly to war. These ideas prevail
throughout the whole of Greece, particularly among the Lacedaemonians.
Corinth is the place where mechanics are least despised.</p>
<p id="passage-184"><a href="#passage-184" class="passage-id">184</a> The warrior class in Egypt had certain special privileges in which
none of the rest of the Egyptians participated, except the priests. In
the first place each man had twelve arurae of land assigned him free
from tax. (The arura is a square of a hundred Egyptian cubits, the
Egyptian cubit being of the same length as the Samian.) All the
warriors enjoyed this privilege together, but there were other
advantages which came to each in rotation, the same man never
obtaining them twice. A thousand Calascirians, and the same number
of Hermotybians, formed in alternate years the body-guard of the king;
and during their year of service these persons, besides their
arurae, received a daily portion of meat and drink, consisting of five
pounds of baked bread, two pounds of beef, and four cups of wine.</p>
<p id="passage-185"><a href="#passage-185" class="passage-id">185</a> When Apries, at the head of his mercenaries, and Amasis, in
command of the whole native force of the Egyptians, encountered one
another near the city of Momemphis, an engagement presently took
place. The foreign troops fought bravely, but were overpowered by
numbers, in which they fell very far short of their adversaries. It is
said that Apries believed that there was not a god who could cast
him down from his eminence, so firmly did he think that he had
established himself in his kingdom. But at this time the battle went
against him, and his army being worsted, he fell into the enemy's
hands and was brought back a prisoner to Sais, where he was lodged
in what had been his own house, but was now the palace of Amasis.
Amasis treated him with kindness, and kept him in the palace for a
while; but finding his conduct blamed by the Egyptians, who charged
him with acting unjustly in preserving a man who had shown himself
so bitter an enemy both to them and him, he gave Apries over into
the hands of his former subjects, to deal with as they chose. Then the
Egyptians took him and strangled him, but having so done they buried
him in the sepulchre of his fathers. This tomb is in the temple of
Minerva, very near the sanctuary, on the left hand as one enters.
The Saites buried all the kings who belonged to their canton inside
this temple; and thus it even contains the tomb of Amasis, as well
as that of Apries and his family. The latter is not so close to the
sanctuary as the former, but still it is within the temple. It
stands in the court, and is a spacious cloister built of stone and
adorned with pillars carved so as to resemble palm trees, and with
other sumptuous ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with
folding doors, behind which lies the sepulchre of the king.</p>
<p id="passage-186"><a href="#passage-186" class="passage-id">186</a> Here too, in this same precinct of Minerva at Sais, is the
burial-place of one whom I think it not right to mention in such a
connection. It stands behind the temple, against the backwall, which
it entirely covers. There are also some large stone obelisks in the
enclosure, and there is a lake near them, adorned with an edging of
stone. In form it is circular, and in size, as it seemed to me,
about equal to the lake in Delos called "the Hoop."</p>
<p id="passage-187"><a href="#passage-187" class="passage-id">187</a> On this lake it is that the Egyptians represent by night his
sufferings whose name I refrain from mentioning, and this
representation they call their Mysteries. I know well the whole course
of the proceedings in these ceremonies, but they shall not pass my
lips. So too, with regard to the mysteries of Ceres, which the
Greeks term "the Thesmophoria," I know them, but I shall not mention
them, except so far as may be done without impiety. The daughters of
Danaus brought these rites from Egypt, and taught them to the Pelasgic
women of the Peloponnese. Afterwards, when the inhabitants of the
peninsula were driven from their homes by the Dorians, the rites
perished. Only in Arcadia, where the natives remained and were not
compelled to migrate, their observance continued.</p>
<p id="passage-188"><a href="#passage-188" class="passage-id">188</a> After Apries had been put to death in the way that I have
described above, Amasis reigned over Egypt. He belonged to the
canton of Sais, being a native of the town called Siouph. At first his
subjects looked down on him and held him in small esteem, because he
had been a mere private person, and of a house of no great
distinction; but after a time Amasis succeeded in reconciling them
to his rule, not by severity, but by cleverness. Among his other
splendour he had a golden foot-pan, in which his guests and himself
were wont upon occasion to wash their feet. This vessel he caused to
be broken in pieces, and made of the gold an image of one of the gods,
which he set up in the most public place in the whole city; upon which
the Egyptians flocked to the image, and worshipped it with the
utmost reverence. Amasis, finding this was so, called an assembly, and
opened the matter to them, explaining how the image had been made of
the foot-pan, wherein they had been wont formerly to wash their feet
and to put all manner of filth, yet now it was greatly reverenced.
"And truly," he went on to say, "it had gone with him as with the
foot-pan. If he was a private person formerly, yet now he had come
to be their king. And so he bade them honour and reverence him."
Such was the mode in which he won over the Egyptians, and brought them
to be content to do him service.</p>
<p id="passage-189"><a href="#passage-189" class="passage-id">189</a> The following was the general habit of his life:- from early
dawn to the time when the forum is wont to fill, he sedulously
transacted all the business that was brought before him; during the
remainder of the day he drank and joked with his guests, passing the
time in witty and, sometimes, scarce seemly conversation. It grieved
his friends that he should thus demean himself, and accordingly some
of them chid him on the subject, saying to him- "Oh! king, thou dost
but ill guard thy royal dignity whilst thou allowest thyself in such
levities. Thou shouldest sit in state upon a stately throne, and
busy thyself with affairs the whole day long. So would the Egyptians
feel that a great man rules them, and thou wouldst be better spoken
of. But now thou conductest thyself in no kingly fashion." Amasis
answered them thus:- "Bowmen bend their bows when they wish to
shoot; unbrace them when the shooting is over. Were they kept always
strung they would break, and fail the archer in time of need. So it is
with men. If they give themselves constantly to serious work, and
never indulge awhile in pastime or sport, they lose their senses,
and become mad or moody. Knowing this, I divide my life between
pastime and business." Thus he answered his friends.</p>
<p id="passage-190"><a href="#passage-190" class="passage-id">190</a> It is said that Amasis, even while he was a private man, had the
same tastes for drinking and jesting, and was averse to engaging in
any serious employment. He lived in constant feasts and revelries, and
whenever his means failed him, he roamed about and robbed people. On
such occasions the persons from whom he had stolen would bring him, if
he denied the charge, before the nearest oracle; sometimes the
oracle would pronounce him guilty of the theft, at other times it
would acquit him. When afterwards he came to be king, he neglected the
temples of such gods as had declared that he was not a thief, and
neither contributed to their adornment nor frequented them for
sacrifice, since he regarded them as utterly worthless and their
oracles as wholly false: but the gods who had detected his guilt he
considered to be true gods whose oracles did not deceive, and these he
honoured exceedingly.</p>
<p id="passage-191"><a href="#passage-191" class="passage-id">191</a> First of all, therefore, he built the gateway of the temple of
Minerva at Sais, which is an astonishing work, far surpassing all
other buildings of the same kind both in extent and height, and
built with stones of rare size and excellency. In the next place, he
presented to the temple a number of large colossal statues and several
prodigious andro-sphinxes, besides certain stones for the repairs,
of a most extraordinary size. Some of these he got from the quarries
over against Memphis, but the largest were brought from Elephantine,
which is twenty days' voyage from Sais. Of all these wonderful
masses that which I most admire is a chamber made of a single stone,
which was quarried at Elephantine. It took three years to convey
this block from the quarry to Sais; and in the conveyance were
employed no fewer than two thousand labourers, who were all from the
class of boatmen. The length of this chamber on the outside is
twenty-one cubits, its breadth fourteen cubits, and its height, eight.
The measurements inside are the following:- the length, eighteen
cubits and five-sixths; the breadth, twelve cubits; and the height,
five. It lies near the entrance of the temple, where it was left in
consequence of the following circumstance:- it happened that the
architect, just as the stone had reached the spot where it now stands,
heaved a sigh, considering the length of time that the removal had
taken, and feeling wearied with the heavy toil. The sigh was heard
by Amasis who, regarding it as an omen, would not allow the chamber to
be moved forward any farther. Some, however, say that one of the
workmen engaged at the levers was crushed and killed by the mass,
and that this was the reason of its being left where it now stands.</p>
<p id="passage-192"><a href="#passage-192" class="passage-id">192</a> To the other temples of much note Amasis also made magnificent
offerings- at Memphis, for instance, he gave the recumbent colossus in
front of the temple of Vulcan, which is seventy-five feet long. Two
other colossal statues stand on the same base, each twenty feet
high, carved in the stone of Ethiopia, one on either side of the
temple. There is also a stone colossus of the same size at Says,
recumbent like that at Memphis. Amasis finally built the temple of
Isis at Memphis, a vast structure, well worth seeing.</p>
<p id="passage-193"><a href="#passage-193" class="passage-id">193</a> It is said that the reign of Amasis was the most prosperous time
that Egypt ever saw,- the river was more liberal to the land, and
the land brought forth more abundantly for the service of man than had
ever been known before; while the number of inhabited cities was not
less than twenty thousand. It was this king Amasis who established the
law that every Egyptian should appear once a year before the
governor of his canton, and show his means of living; or, failing to
do so, and to prove that he got an honest livelihood, should be put to
death. Solon the Athenian borrowed this law from the Egyptians, and
imposed it on his countrymen, who have observed it ever since. It is
indeed an excellent custom.</p>
<p id="passage-194"><a href="#passage-194" class="passage-id">194</a> Amasis was partial to the Greeks, and among other favours which he
granted them, gave to such as liked to settle in Egypt the city of
Naucratis for their residence. To those who only wished to trade
upon the coast, and did not want to fix their abode in the country, he
granted certain lands where they might set up altars and erect temples
to the gods. Of these temples the grandest and most famous, which is
also the most frequented, is that called "the Hellenium." It was built
conjointly by the Ionians, Dorians, and Aeolians, the following cities
taking part in the work:- the Ionian states of Chios, Teos, Phocaea,
and Clazomenae; Rhodes, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, and Phaselis of the
Dorians; and Mytilene of the Aeolians. These are the states to whom
the temple belongs, and they have the right of appointing the
governors of the factory; the other cities which claim a share in
the building, claim what in no sense belongs to them. Three nations,
however, consecrated for themselves separate temples- the Eginetans
one to Jupiter, the Samians to Juno, and the Milesians to Apollo.</p>
<p id="passage-195"><a href="#passage-195" class="passage-id">195</a> In ancient times there was no factory but Naucratis in the whole
of Egypt; and if a person entered one of the other mouths of the Nile,
he was obliged to swear that he had not come there of his own free
will. Having so done, he was bound to sail in his ship to the
Canobic mouth, or were that impossible owing to contrary winds, he
must take his wares by boat all round the Delta, and so bring them
to Naucratis, which had an exclusive privilege.</p>
<p id="passage-196"><a href="#passage-196" class="passage-id">196</a> It happened in the reign of Amasis that the temple of Delphi had
been accidentally burnt, and the Amphictyons had contracted to have it
rebuilt for three hundred talents, of which sum one-fourth was to be
furnished by the Delphians. Under these circumstances the Delphians
went from city to city begging contributions, and among their other
wanderings came to Egypt and asked for help. From few other places did
they obtain so much- Amasis gave them a thousand talents of alum,
and the Greek settlers twenty minae.</p>
<p id="passage-197"><a href="#passage-197" class="passage-id">197</a> A league was concluded by Amasis with the Cyrenaeans, by which
Cyrene and Egypt became close friends and allies. He likewise took a
wife from that city, either as a sign of his friendly feeling, or
because he had a fancy to marry a Greek woman. However this may be,
certain it is that he espoused a lady of Cyrene, by name Ladice,
daughter, some say, of Battus or Arcesilaus, the king- others, of
Critobulus, one of the chief citizens. When the time came to
complete the contract, Amasis was struck with weakness. Astonished
hereat- for he was not wont to be so afflicted- the king thus
addressed his bride: "Woman, thou hast certainly bewitched me- now
therefore be sure thou shalt perish more miserably than ever woman
perished yet." Ladice protested her innocence, but in vain; Amasis was
not softened. Hereupon she made a vow internally, that if he recovered
within the day (for no longer time was allowed her), she would present
a statue to the temple of Venus at Cyrene. Immediately she obtained
her wish, and the king's weakness disappeared. Amasis loved her
greatly ever after, and Ladice performed her vow. The statue which she
caused to be made, and sent to Cyrene continued there to my day,
standing with its face looking outwards from the city. Ladice herself,
when Cambyses conquered Egypt, suffered no wrong; for Cambyses, on
learning of her who she was, sent her back unharmed to her country.</p>
<p id="passage-198"><a href="#passage-198" class="passage-id">198</a> Besides the marks of favour already mentioned, Amasis also
enriched with offerings many of the Greek temples. He sent to Cyrene a
statue of Minerva covered with plates of gold, and a painted
likeness of himself. To the Minerva of Lindus he gave two statues in
stone, and a linen corslet well worth inspection. To the Samian Juno
he presented two statues of himself, made in wood, which stood in
the great temple to my day, behind the doors. Samos was honoured
with these gifts on account of the bond of friendship subsisting
between Amasis and Polycrates, the son of Aeaces: Lindus, for no
such reason, but because of the tradition that the daughters of Danaus
touched there in their flight from the sons of Aegyptus, and built the
temple of Minerva. Such were the offerings of Amasis. He likewise took
Cyprus, which no man had ever done before, and compelled it to pay him
a tribute.</p>
